The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLooking at this conversation chronologically:\n\n1. **Initial Request**: User asked if the Organizer v1.1 Implementation Plan was ready for implementation, providing a file path.\n\n2. **Plan Review Process**: I read the implementation plan and confirmed it was comprehensive and ready. The user then requested I submit it to a plan-reviewer agent.\n\n3. **Plan Rejection**: The plan-reviewer agent rejected the plan for missing mandatory requirements:\n   - Missing executive summary with formal problem statement\n   - Inaccurate file names and missing line counts\n   - Missing granular success criteria\n   - Missing complexity and breaking risk estimates\n   - Missing rollback mechanisms\n   - Missing internet research for high complexity steps\n\n4. **Plan Revision Request**: User explicitly asked me to \"Please make the fixes as required by the plan reviewer\"\n\n5. **Research and Analysis Phase**: I researched the current codebase to get accurate file information:\n   - Found Organizer.vue (187 lines), organizer.js (353 lines), TagInput.vue (275 lines)\n   - Conducted internet research on Vue 3 category-based tagging best practices\n   - Identified that the 353-line organizer.js file exceeded guidelines and needed decomposition\n\n6. **Plan Fixes Implementation**: I comprehensively revised the implementation plan addressing all mandatory requirements:\n   - Added executive summary with formal problem statement\n   - Corrected file names and provided accurate line counts\n   - Added granular success criteria with specific metrics\n   - Added complexity/risk estimates (Low/Medium/High) for each phase\n   - Added rollback mechanisms for risky operations\n   - Resequenced phases (migration before new features)\n   - Included Vue 3 research findings\n   - Added store decomposition plan\n\n7. **Plan Resubmission**: User requested \"resubmit\" and the plan-reviewer approved the revised plan.\n\n8. **Implementation Begin**: User said \"Yes. but I have moved the plan to here: planning\\3. In progress\\Organizer-v1.1-Implementation-Plan.md\" indicating to begin implementation with the moved plan.\n\n9. **Phase 1 Implementation**: I began implementing Phase 1 (Store Decomposition & Data Structure):\n   - Read the moved plan file\n   - Analyzed the current 353-line organizer.js store\n   - Decomposed it into 4 focused stores (<300 lines each)\n   - Created category service with full CRUD operations\n   - Created comprehensive Evidence structure documentation\n   - Completed all Phase 1 tasks successfully\n\nThe user's intent was clear: fix the plan according to reviewer requirements, get approval, then begin implementation starting with Phase 1.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user initially asked if the Organizer v1.1 Implementation Plan was ready for implementation. When the plan-reviewer agent rejected it for missing mandatory requirements, the user explicitly requested: \"Please make the fixes as required by the plan reviewer.\" After plan approval, the user moved the plan to the \"In progress\" folder and confirmed to begin implementation with \"Yes. but I have moved the plan to here: planning\\3. In progress\\Organizer-v1.1-Implementation-Plan.md\"\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax\n   - Pinia state management with store decomposition\n   - Category-based tagging system architecture\n   - Firestore database schema design\n   - Backward compatibility preservation\n   - Legacy tag migration strategies\n   - Facade design pattern for API compatibility\n   - Feature flag rollback mechanisms\n   - TypeScript integration for strong typing\n   - Composable extraction and modular architecture\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - **planning\\3. In progress\\Organizer-v1.1-Implementation-Plan.md**\n     - Critical implementation plan that was revised to meet all mandatory requirements\n     - Added executive summary with formal problem statement about free-form tagging challenges\n     - Added granular success criteria and complexity/risk estimates for each phase\n   \n   - **src\\features\\organizer\\stores\\organizer.js** (Original 354 lines → 240 lines)\n     - Refactored to use facade pattern maintaining backward compatibility\n     - Key code: `export const useOrganizerStore = defineStore('organizer', () => { const coreStore = useOrganizerCoreStore(); const categoryStore = useCategoryStore(); const tagStore = useTagStore(); const migrationStore = useMigrationStore();`\n   \n   - **src\\features\\organizer\\stores\\categoryStore.js** (267 lines)\n     - New focused store for category CRUD operations\n     - Key code: `const createCategory = async (categoryData) => { if (!categoryData.name || !categoryData.name.trim()) { throw new Error('Category name is required'); }`\n   \n   - **src\\features\\organizer\\stores\\tagStore.js** (264 lines)\n     - New focused store for structured tag operations\n     - Key code: `const updateEvidenceStructuredTags = async (evidenceId, tagsByHuman = [], tagsByAI = []) => { validateStructuredTags(tagsByHuman); validateStructuredTags(tagsByAI);`\n   \n   - **src\\features\\organizer\\stores\\migrationStore.js** (296 lines)\n     - New focused store for legacy tag migration\n     - Key code: `const analyzeLegacyTags = async () => { const evidenceRef = collection(db, 'teams', teamId, 'evidence'); const evidenceQuery = query(evidenceRef, where('tags', '!=', null));`\n   \n   - **src\\features\\organizer\\stores\\organizerCore.js** (289 lines)\n     - New focused store for core evidence loading and filtering\n     - Key code: `const applyFiltersWithCategories = (categoryFilters = {}) => { Object.entries(categoryFilters).forEach(([categoryId, selectedTags]) => { if (selectedTags.length > 0) {`\n   \n   - **src\\features\\organizer\\services\\categoryService.js** (324 lines)\n     - Comprehensive category service with validation and CRUD operations\n     - Key code: `static validateCategoryData(categoryData) { if (!categoryData.name || typeof categoryData.name !== 'string' || !categoryData.name.trim()) { errors.push('Category name is required'); }`\n   \n   - **docs\\data-structures\\evidence-v1.1-schema.md**\n     - Complete documentation of updated Evidence document structure\n     - Defines backward compatibility strategy and structured tag format\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **Plan Reviewer Rejection**: The initial plan was missing mandatory requirements (executive summary, file accuracy, granular criteria, etc.). Fixed by comprehensively revising the plan to address all identified issues.\n   - **File Name Inaccuracies**: Plan mentioned \"EvidenceCard.vue\" which doesn't exist and \"OrganizerStore.js\" instead of \"organizer.js\". Fixed by researching actual codebase structure and providing accurate file names and line counts.\n   - **Store Size Violation**: The 353-line organizer.js exceeded the 300-line guideline. Fixed by decomposing it into 4 focused stores, each under 300 lines.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Solved the plan approval blocker by systematically addressing all mandatory requirements\n   - Solved the large file size problem through strategic store decomposition using facade pattern\n   - Solved backward compatibility challenges by preserving all v1.0 APIs while adding v1.1 features\n   - Implemented comprehensive validation and rollback mechanisms for data safety\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"Is: planning\\1. Ideas\\Organizer-v1.1-Implementation-Plan.md\\ Ready for implementation\"\n   - \"submit it to the plan reviewer agent\"\n   - \"Please make the fixes as required by the plan reviewer\"\n   - \"resubmit\"\n   - \"Yes.\\ \\ but I have moved the plan to here:\\ planning\\3. In progress\\Organizer-v1.1-Implementation-Plan.md\"\n   - \"continue\"\n   - \"Your task is to create a detailed summary...\" (current request)\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Phase 2: Migration & Compatibility (Week 1-2) - Build MigrationDialog.vue, implement legacy tag preservation, create batch migration utilities\n   - Phase 3: Category Management UI (Week 2) - Build CategoryManager.vue, CategoryForm.vue, ColorPicker.vue components\n   - Phase 4: Tag Assignment Interface (Week 2-3) - Replace TagInput.vue with TagSelector.vue\n   - Phase 5: Enhanced Search & Display (Week 3) - Update search for structured tags\n   - Phase 6: Testing & Polish (Week 3) - Comprehensive testing and UX polish\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Just completed Phase 1 implementation (Store Decomposition & Data Structure). Successfully decomposed the 354-line organizer.js into 4 focused stores, created comprehensive category service with validation, and documented the updated Evidence structure for v1.1. All Phase 1 granular success criteria have been met including store decomposition, schema creation, validation implementation, and rollback mechanisms.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Begin Phase 2: Migration & Compatibility implementation, starting with building the MigrationDialog.vue component for v1.0 tag migration. This follows the approved plan sequence and the user's explicit instruction to continue with implementation after the successful Phase 1 completion.."}]},"isVisibleInTranscriptOnly":true,"isCompactSummary":true,"uuid":"75976a9a-52a6-44ec-b076-80b6e0ebec9c","timestamp":"2025-08-30T07:10:40.909Z"}

In progress\\Organizer-v1.1-Implementation-Plan.md","content":"# Organizer v1.1 Implementation Plan: Category-Based Tag System\n\n**Version**: 1.1  \n**Target Completion**: 3 weeks  \n**Dependencies**: Organizer v1.0 (✅ Completed August 29, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n### Problem Statement\nThe current Organizer v1.0 uses a free-form tagging system that creates several organizational challenges:\n- **Inconsistent Tagging**: Users type variations of the same concept (\"invoice\", \"invoices\", \"Invoice\")\n- **Poor Visual Organization**: No visual distinction between different types of tags\n- **Limited Structure**: Cannot group related tags or enforce consistent categorization\n- **Search Inefficiency**: Difficult to filter by specific tag types or relationships\n- **AI Integration Barriers**: Unstructured data prevents effective AI categorization in future versions\n\n### Proposed Solution\nTransform the free-form tag system into a structured category-based system where:\n1. Users define categories (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n2. Each category contains predefined tag options with consistent naming\n3. Visual color coding distinguishes between categories\n4. Structured data enables AI processing in v1.2\n5. Full backward compatibility preserves existing v1.0 functionality\n\n### Key Files and Current State\n- **Organizer.vue** (187 lines) - Main organizer view requiring category management integration\n- **organizer.js** (353 lines) - Pinia store requiring decomposition and category logic\n- **TagInput.vue** (275 lines) - Component to be replaced with category-based selection\n- **OrganizerHeader.vue**, **OrganizerStates.vue** - Supporting components requiring updates\n\n### Internet Research Summary\n**Vue 3 Category-Based Tagging Best Practices (2024-2025):**\n- **Composable Architecture**: Logic should be extracted into dedicated composables for tag management, category handling, and color systems\n- **Modular Design**: Large files (like 353-line organizer.js) should be decomposed into focused modules\n- **TypeScript Integration**: Strong typing prevents runtime errors in complex tag systems\n- **Performance Patterns**: Use computed properties for expensive operations, debounced search, and virtual scrolling\n- **State Management**: Pinia with Composition API provides optimal state management for category systems\n- **Testing Strategy**: Vitest enables comprehensive testing of composables and business logic\n\n## Overview\n\nVersion 1.1 transforms the free-form tag system from v1.0 into a structured category-based system where users define categories (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\") and assign specific tags within each category. This provides better organization, visual clarity through color coding, and lays the foundation for AI processing in v1.2.\n\n## Core Goals\n\n1. **Replace free-form tags** with structured category-based tags\n2. **Add category management interface** for creating/editing categories\n3. **Implement color coding** by category for visual organization\n4. **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing v1.0 tags\n5. **Prepare data structure** for AI categorization in v1.2\n\n## User Stories\n\n### Category Management Stories\n- **As a user, I want to create custom categories** like \"Document Type\", \"Institution\", \"Date Range\" to organize my specific document types\n- **As a user, I want to define tag options within each category** so I can select from predefined choices rather than typing free-form text\n- **As a user, I want to edit categories and their tag options** so I can refine my organization system over time\n- **As a user, I want to see color-coded tags** so I can visually distinguish between different category types\n\n### Tag Assignment Stories\n- **As a user, I want to assign tags from category dropdowns** instead of typing free-form text for more consistent tagging\n- **As a user, I want to assign multiple tags per document** across different categories (e.g., \"Invoice\" + \"Q3 2024\" + \"Bank of America\")\n- **As a user, I want my existing v1.0 tags preserved** and optionally migrated to the new category system\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Data Structure Changes\n\n#### New Collections\n```javascript\n// /teams/{teamId}/categories/\n{\n  id: \"category-uuid\",\n  name: \"Document Type\", \n  color: \"#1976d2\",         // Primary category color\n  createdAt: timestamp,\n  updatedAt: timestamp,\n  isActive: true,\n  tags: [                   // Available tag options for this category\n    {\n      id: \"tag-uuid\",\n      name: \"Invoice\",\n      color: \"#1976d2\"        // Inherits category color with variations\n    },\n    {\n      id: \"tag-uuid-2\", \n      name: \"Statement\",\n      color: \"#1565c0\"        // Darker shade of category color\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Updated Evidence Structure\n```javascript\n// /teams/{teamId}/evidence/{evidenceId}\n{\n  // ... existing fields ...\n  tagsByHuman: [             // Updated structure\n    {\n      categoryId: \"category-uuid\",\n      categoryName: \"Document Type\",  // Denormalized for performance\n      tagId: \"tag-uuid\",\n      tagName: \"Invoice\",            // Denormalized for performance  \n      color: \"#1976d2\"\n    }\n  ],\n  tagsByAI: [               // Same structure, ready for v1.2\n    // Similar tag objects\n  ],\n  legacyTags: [             // Preserve v1.0 free-form tags\n    \"invoice\", \"q3-2024\"    // Original string tags from v1.0\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Color System\n\n#### Category Colors\n- **Document Type**: Blue (#1976d2)\n- **Date/Period**: Green (#388e3c) \n- **Institution**: Orange (#f57c00)\n- **Custom Categories**: Auto-assigned from predefined palette\n\n#### Tag Color Variations\n- Base category color for primary tag in category\n- Lighter/darker shades for additional tags in same category\n- Ensures visual consistency within categories\n\n### Component Architecture\n\n#### New Components\n1. **CategoryManager.vue** - Main category management interface\n2. **CategoryForm.vue** - Create/edit individual categories\n3. **TagSelector.vue** - Replaces TagInput.vue with category-based selection\n4. **ColorPicker.vue** - Category color selection component\n5. **MigrationDialog.vue** - Migrate v1.0 tags to categories\n\n#### Updated Components\n1. **Organizer.vue** (187 lines) - Updated layout for category management access\n2. **File display components** - Updated tag display with color coding (no EvidenceCard.vue found in codebase)\n3. **organizer.js store** (353 lines) - Enhanced with category management logic\n\n### Store Decomposition Plan\n**Critical**: The organizer.js store (353 lines) exceeds the 300-line guideline and must be decomposed before implementation:\n- **categoryStore.js** -

Check for any error messages in the console (red text)\n2. Tell me what you see in the Organizer interface - is it completely blank, or do you see headers/navigation but no document list?\n3.

Rather than traditional folder storage, it uses a tag-based flat storage system with virtual folder presentations optimized for legal document management workflows.\n     6→\n     7→## Core Purpose\n     8→\n     9→**Primary Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.\n    10→\n    11→**Target Use Cases**:\n    12→- Finding bank statements by institution and account details\n    13→- Locating photographs by location and date\n    14→- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)\n    15→- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation\n    16→\n    17→## Architecture Overview\n    18→\n    19→### Storage Strategy\n    20→- **File Storage**: Continues using Storage 1 (existing Firebase Storage)\n    21→- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection for organization metadata\n    22→- **Reference Architecture**: Evidence entries point to files via fileHash\n    23→- **No File Duplication**: Multiple evidence entries can reference same stored file\n    24→- **Processing States**: Evidence tracks document through processing workflow\n    25→\n    26→### Processing Workflow\n    27→1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)\n    28→2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly\n    29→3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review\n    30→4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples\n    31→\n    32→## Tag System Design\n    33→\n    34→### Category Structure\n    35→- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n    36→- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\", \"Contract\")\n    37→- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability\n    38→\n    39→### Tag Management\n    40→- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options\n    41→- **Add/Delete Operations**: \n    42→  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents\n    43→  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files\n    44→- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options\n    45→\n    46→### AI Processing Approach\n    47→- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n    48→- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n    49→- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints\n    50→- **Separate Tag Arrays**: AI tags stored in `tagsByAI`, human tags in `tagsByHuman`\n    51→- **Two-Pass Algorithm**:\n    52→  1. **High Confidence Pass**: >90% confidence files get tags added to `tagsByAI`\n    53→  2. **Context-Enhanced Pass**: Medium confidence files use previous examples from both tag arrays\n    54→\n    55→## User Interface Design\n    56→\n    57→### Flat View (Default)\n    58→- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags\n    59→- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping\n    60→- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n    61→\n    62→### Virtual Folder View\n    63→- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n    64→- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n    65→- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n    66→- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n    67→\n    68→### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n    69→- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n    70→- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n    71→- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n    72→\n    73→## Human Review System\n    74→\n    75→### Uncertainty Handling\n    76→- **Review Folder**: \"Human Review Required\" category for uncertain classifications\n    77→- **Confidence Thresholds**: User-adjustable sensitivity settings\n    78→- **Review Interface**: \n    79→  - Top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n    80→  - \"Other\" option for complete misclassification\n    81→  - \"Create New Category\" for expanding taxonomy\n    82→\n    83→### Learning Approach\n    84→- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n    85→- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future medium-confidence decisions\n    86→- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n    87→\n    88→## BATES Numbering System\n    89→\n    90→### Legal Workflow Integration\n    91→- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n    92→- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n    93→- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n    94→  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n    95→\n    96→### Numbering Rules\n    97→- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n    98→- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n    99→- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n   100→- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n   101→- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n   102→\n   103→### Deduplication Integration\n   104→- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n   105→- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n   106→\n   107→## Integration with Document Processing Workflow\n   108→\n   109→### Evidence Database Role\n   110→- **Central Registry**: All processed documents tracked in Evidence database\n   111→- **Processing Status**: Tracks files through upload → split → merge pipeline\n   112→- **Quality Tracking**: Records hasAllPages and completeness status\n   113→- **Multi-Storage Support**: References files across uploads/split/merged folders\n   114→\n   115→### Version 1.0 Preparation\n   116→- Evidence schema includes processing fields (unused in v1.0)\n   117→- Storage reference structure supports future split/merged folders\n   118→- Processing status defaults to \"uploaded\" for all v1.0 entries\n   119→- Future versions update these fields without schema changes\n   120→\n   121→## Technical Implementation Approach\n   122→\n   123→### AI Integration\n   124→- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n   125→- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n   126→- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n   127→\n   128→### Data Storage\n   129→- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n   130→- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection `/teams/{teamId}/evidence/`\n   131→- **Storage References**: Evidence documents reference files via:\n   132→  - `storageRef.storage`: Which storage folder (uploads/split/merged)\n   133→  - `storageRef.fileHash`: Unique file identifier\n   134→- **Display References**: Evidence points to specific metadata records via:\n   135→  -

Ideas\\Organizer-Feature-Reference.md","content":"# Organizer Feature Reference Document\n\n## Overview\n\nThe **Organizer** is an AI-powered document discovery and organization system designed to help users find previously uploaded files through intelligent categorization and flexible viewing interfaces. Rather than traditional folder storage, it uses a tag-based flat storage system with virtual folder presentations optimized for legal document management workflows.\n\n## Core Purpose\n\n**Primary Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.\n\n**Target Use Cases**:\n- Finding bank statements by institution and account details\n- Locating photographs by location and date\n- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)\n- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Storage Strategy\n- **File Storage**: Continues using Storage 1 (existing Firebase Storage)\n- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection for organization metadata\n- **Reference Architecture**: Evidence entries point to files via fileHash\n- **No File Duplication**: Multiple evidence entries can reference same stored file\n- **Processing States**: Evidence tracks document through processing workflow\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)\n2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly\n3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review\n4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples\n\n## Tag System Design\n\n### Category Structure\n- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\", \"Contract\")\n- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability\n\n### Tag Management\n- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options\n- **Add/Delete Operations**: \n  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents\n  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files\n- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options\n\n### AI Processing Approach\n- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints\n- **Separate Tag Arrays**: AI tags stored in `tagsByAI`, human tags in `tagsByHuman`\n- **Two-Pass Algorithm**:\n  1. **High Confidence Pass**: >90% confidence files get tags added to `tagsByAI`\n  2. **Context-Enhanced Pass**: Medium confidence files use previous examples from both tag arrays\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Flat View (Default)\n- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags\n- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n\n### Virtual Folder View\n- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n\n### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n\n## Human Review System\n\n### Uncertainty Handling\n- **Review Folder**: \"Human Review Required\" category for uncertain classifications\n- **Confidence Thresholds**: User-adjustable sensitivity settings\n- **Review Interface**: \n  - Top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n  - \"Other\" option for complete misclassification\n  - \"Create New Category\" for expanding taxonomy\n\n### Learning Approach\n- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future medium-confidence decisions\n- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n\n## BATES Numbering System\n\n### Legal Workflow Integration\n- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n\n### Numbering Rules\n- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n\n### Deduplication Integration\n- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n\n## Integration with Document Processing Workflow\n\n### Evidence Database Role\n- **Central Registry**: All processed documents tracked in Evidence database\n- **Processing Status**: Tracks files through upload → split → merge pipeline\n- **Quality Tracking**: Records hasAllPages and completeness status\n- **Multi-Storage Support**: References files across uploads/split/merged folders\n\n### Version 1.0 Preparation\n- Evidence schema includes processing fields (unused in v1.0)\n- Storage reference structure supports future split/merged folders\n- Processing status defaults to \"uploaded\" for all v1.0 entries\n- Future versions update these fields without schema changes\n\n## Technical Implementation Approach\n\n### AI Integration\n- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n\n### Data Storage\n- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection `/teams/{teamId}/evidence/`\n- **Storage References**: Evidence documents reference files via:\n  - `storageRef.storage`: Which storage folder (uploads/split/merged)\n  - `storageRef.fileHash`: Unique file identifier\n- **Display References**: Evidence points to specific metadata records via:\n  - `displayCopy.metadataHash`: Points to chosen originalMetadata record\n  - `displayCopy.folderPath`: User-chosen folder path from that record\n- **Processing Metadata**: Evidence tracks isProcessed, hasAllPages, processingStage\n- **Tag Storage**: Separated by source (tagsByAI, tagsByHuman arrays)\n- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n\n## User Stories\n\n### Document Discovery Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to find bank statements by

Rather than traditional folder storage, it uses a tag-based flat storage system with virtual folder presentations optimized for legal document management workflows.\n\n## Core Purpose\n\n**Primary Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.\n\n**Target Use Cases**:\n- Finding bank statements by institution and account details\n- Locating photographs by location and date\n- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)\n- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Storage Strategy\n- **File Storage**: Continues using Storage 1 (existing Firebase Storage)\n- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection for organization metadata\n- **Reference Architecture**: Evidence entries point to files via fileHash\n- **No File Duplication**: Multiple evidence entries can reference same stored file\n- **Processing States**: Evidence tracks document through processing workflow\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)\n2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly\n3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review\n4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples\n\n## Tag System Design\n\n### Category Structure\n- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\", \"Contract\")\n- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability\n\n### Tag Management\n- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options\n- **Add/Delete Operations**: \n  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents\n  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files\n- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options\n\n### AI Processing Approach\n- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints\n- **Separate Tag Arrays**: AI tags stored in `tagsByAI`, human tags in `tagsByHuman`\n- **Two-Pass Algorithm**:\n  1. **High Confidence Pass**: >90% confidence files get tags added to `tagsByAI`\n  2. **Context-Enhanced Pass**: Medium confidence files use previous examples from both tag arrays\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Flat View (Default)\n- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags\n- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n\n### Virtual Folder View\n- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n\n### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n\n## Human Review System\n\n### Uncertainty Handling\n- **Review Folder**: \"Human Review Required\" category for uncertain classifications\n- **Confidence Thresholds**: User-adjustable sensitivity settings\n- **Review Interface**: \n  - Top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n  - \"Other\" option for complete misclassification\n  - \"Create New Category\" for expanding taxonomy\n\n### Learning Approach\n- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future medium-confidence decisions\n- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n\n## BATES Numbering System\n\n### Legal Workflow Integration\n- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n\n### Numbering Rules\n- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n\n### Deduplication Integration\n- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n\n## Integration with Document Processing Workflow\n\n### Evidence Database Role\n- **Central Registry**: All processed documents tracked in Evidence database\n- **Processing Status**: Tracks files through upload → split → merge pipeline\n- **Quality Tracking**: Records hasAllPages and completeness status\n- **Multi-Storage Support**: References files across uploads/split/merged folders\n\n### Version 1.0 Preparation\n- Evidence schema includes processing fields (unused in v1.0)\n- Storage reference structure supports future split/merged folders\n- Processing status defaults to \"uploaded\" for all v1.0 entries\n- Future versions update these fields without schema changes\n\n## Technical Implementation Approach\n\n### AI Integration\n- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n\n### Data Storage\n- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection `/teams/{teamId}/evidence/`\n- **Storage References**: Evidence documents reference files via:\n  - `storageRef.storage`: Which storage folder (uploads/split/merged)\n  - `storageRef.fileHash`: Unique file identifier\n- **Display References**: Evidence points to specific metadata records via:\n  - `displayCopy.metadataHash`: Points to chosen originalMetadata record\n  - `displayCopy.folderPath`: User-chosen folder path from that record\n- **Processing Metadata**: Evidence tracks isProcessed, hasAllPages, processingStage\n- **Tag Storage**: Separated by source (tagsByAI, tagsByHuman arrays)\n- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n\n## User Stories\n\n### Document Discovery Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to find bank statements by institution and account details**\n- Given I have uploaded hundreds of financial documents\n- When I need to find Royal Bank of Canada statements for account ending in 334\n- Then I can use tags to

document's evolution\n\n### Category Management Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to create custom document categories**\n- Given I have unique document types specific to my practice\n- When I create a new \"Document Type\" category\n- Then I can define custom tags like \"Affidavit\", \"Motion\", \"Brief\"\n- So that my organization system matches my specific workflow needs\n\n**As a user, I want to add new tag options to existing categories**\n- Given I encounter a new type of document not in my current system\n- When I add a \"Receipt\" tag to my \"Document Type\" category\n- Then the system asks if I want to reprocess existing documents\n- So that previously uploaded receipts can be properly categorized\n\n**As a user, I want to merge duplicate category options**\n- Given I created both \"Invoice\" and \"Bill\" tags but realize they're the same\n- When I delete the \"Bill\" tag and choose to reprocess affected documents\n- Then all documents previously tagged as \"Bill\" are reconsidered for \"Invoice\"\n- So that I can consolidate my categorization scheme without losing data\n\n### AI Processing Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to process documents in batches by category type**\n- Given I have uploaded a folder of mixed financial documents\n- When I select the folder and choose \"Document Type\" processing\n- Then the AI categorizes documents as statements, invoices, receipts, etc.\n- So that I can organize large batches efficiently without manual sorting\n\n**As a user, I want to review uncertain AI classifications**\n- Given the AI is less than 90% confident about some document categorizations\n- When I access the \"Human Review Required\" folder\n- Then I see the top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n- So that I can quickly correct misclassifications and improve system accuracy\n\n**As a user, I want the system to learn from my corrections**\n- Given I have manually classified several uncertain documents\n- When the AI processes similar documents with medium confidence\n- Then it uses my previous classifications as context examples\n- So that the system becomes more accurate for my specific document types\n\n### Interface Navigation Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to start with a comprehensive flat view**\n- Given I have many documents with various tags\n- When I first access the organizer\n- Then I see all files with color-coded tags by category\n- So that I can understand my entire document collection at a glance\n\n**As a user, I want to create folder views by clicking on tags**\n- Given I see documents with various \"Document Type\" tags in flat view\n- When I right-click on a \"Statement\" tag and select \"Show in Folders\"\n- Then my view reorganizes into folders by document type\n- So that I can browse documents in a familiar folder structure\n\n**As a user, I want to drill down through multiple folder levels**\n- Given I have organized by \"Document Type\" and want to sub-organize by date\n- When I right-click on a \"2023\" tag and select \"Show in Folders\"\n- Then I get a hierarchy like \"Statement > 2023 > March\"\n- So that I can narrow down to very specific document sets\n\n**As a user, I want to instantly reorganize my folder hierarchy**\n- Given I have documents organized by Type > Date\n- When I decide I want them organized by Date > Type instead\n- Then the reorganization happens instantly without processing delays\n- So that I can experiment with different organizational schemes efficiently\n\n### BATES Numbering Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to print documents with BATES stamps for disclosure**\n- Given I need to provide document disclosure for trial\n- When I print any document from the organizer\n- Then it includes a BATES number like \"Roberts-0001\" \n- So that I can track disclosed documents and prevent disclosure confusion\n\n**As a legal professional, I want consistent BATES numbering per matter**\n- Given I'm working on multiple legal matters\n- When I set different prefixes for each case (e.g., \"Smith-\", \"Jones-\")\n- Then each case maintains its own sequential numbering\n- So that documents are properly organized by matter\n\n**As a lawyer, I want permanent BATES number assignment**\n- Given I've printed a document with BATES number \"Roberts-0001\"\n- When I print the same document again later\n- Then it always prints with the same BATES number\n- So that I maintain consistency in legal proceedings\n\n**As a user, I want protection against BATES numbering mistakes**\n- Given I need to restart my BATES numbering due to an error\n- When I create a new prefix for the same matter\n- Then the old prefix is permanently retired and cannot be reused\n- So that there's no confusion about which numbering sequence is current\n\n### Human Review Interface Stories\n\n**As a user, I want simple review options for uncertain documents**\n- Given the AI presents a document with uncertain classification\n- When I see the 3 AI suggestions plus \"Other\" and \"Create New Category\" buttons\n- Then I can quickly select the correct option or create a new one\n- So that document review is fast and doesn't interrupt my workflow\n\n**As a user, I want to create new categories during review**\n- Given I encounter a document type not in my current system\n- When I click \"Create New Category\" during human review\n- Then the system asks if I want to reprocess other documents for this new category\n- So that I can expand my taxonomy as I discover new document types\n\n### Legal Workflow Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to prevent raw document downloads**\n- Given clients or opposing parties might create confusion with untracked copies\n- When I access any document in the organizer\n- Then I can only print BATES-stamped versions, not download raw files\n- So that all document copies in circulation are properly tracked and identified\n\n**As a legal professional, I want to track document processing history**\n- Given I need to verify whether documents have been properly processed\n- When I review any document's metadata\n- Then I can see whether it was classified by AI or human review\n- So that I can ensure quality control in my document management process\n\n## User Experience Flow\n\n### Initial Setup\n1.

Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.\n\n**Target Use Cases**:\n- Finding bank statements by institution and account details\n- Locating photographs by location and date\n- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)\n- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Storage Strategy\n- **File Storage**: Continues using Storage 1 (existing Firebase Storage)\n- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection for organization metadata\n- **Reference Architecture**: Evidence entries point to files via fileHash\n- **No File Duplication**: Multiple evidence entries can reference same stored file\n- **Processing States**: Evidence tracks document through processing workflow\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)\n2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly\n3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review\n4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples\n\n## Tag System Design\n\n### Category Structure\n- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\", \"Contract\")\n- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability\n\n### Tag Management\n- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options\n- **Configurable Mutual Exclusivity**: Categories can be set as mutually exclusive (one tag per document) or allow multiple tags\n  - Examples: Document Type (mutually exclusive), Keywords (multiple allowed)\n  - User configurable per category during creation/editing\n- **Add/Delete Operations**: \n  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents\n  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files\n- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options\n\n### AI Processing Approach\n- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints\n- **Separate Tag Arrays**: AI tags stored in `tagsByAI`, human tags in `tagsByHuman`\n- **Two-Pass Algorithm**:\n  1. **High Confidence Pass**: >90% confidence files get tags added to `tagsByAI`\n  2. **Context-Enhanced Pass**: Medium confidence files use previous examples from both tag arrays\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Flat View (Default)\n- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags\n- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n\n### Virtual Folder View\n- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n\n### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n\n## Human Review System\n\n### Uncertainty Handling\n- **Review Folder**: \"Human Review Required\" category for uncertain classifications\n- **Confidence Thresholds**: User-adjustable sensitivity settings\n- **Review Interface**: \n  - Top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n  - \"Other\" option for complete misclassification\n  - \"Create New Category\" for expanding taxonomy\n\n### Learning Approach\n- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future medium-confidence decisions\n- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n\n## BATES Numbering System\n\n### Legal Workflow Integration\n- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n\n### Numbering Rules\n- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n\n### Deduplication Integration\n- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n\n## Integration with Document Processing Workflow\n\n### Evidence Database Role\n- **Central Registry**: All processed documents tracked in Evidence database\n- **Processing Status**: Tracks files through upload → split → merge pipeline\n- **Quality Tracking**: Records hasAllPages and completeness status\n- **Multi-Storage Support**: References files across uploads/split/merged folders\n\n### Version 1.0 Preparation\n- Evidence schema includes processing fields (unused in v1.0)\n- Storage reference structure supports future split/merged folders\n- Processing status defaults to \"uploaded\" for all v1.0 entries\n- Future versions update these fields without schema changes\n\n## Technical Implementation Approach\n\n### AI Integration\n- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n\n### Data Storage\n- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection `/teams/{teamId}/evidence/`\n- **Storage References**: Evidence documents reference files via:\n  - `storageRef.storage`: Which storage folder (uploads/split/merged)\n  - `storageRef.fileHash`: Unique file identifier\n- **Display References**: Evidence points to specific metadata records via:\n  - `displayCopy.metadataHash`: Points to chosen originalMetadata record\n  - `displayCopy.folderPath`: User-chosen folder path from that record\n- **Processing Metadata**: Evidence tracks isProcessed, hasAllPages, processingStage\n- **Tag Storage**: Separated by source (tagsByAI, tagsByHuman arrays)\n- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n\n## User Stories\n\n### Document Discovery
