Upload Progress Visibility Solutions\n- **Immediate UI State Change**: Toggle button to \"Uploading...\" state with spinner, disable interaction, show progress modal immediately\n- **Progressive Loading States**: Multi-stage feedback (preparing → starting → uploading) with visual transitions between states\n- **Toast + Modal Combination**: Brief toast notification for immediate feedback, then transition to detailed progress modal\n\n### 2. Real-Time Upload Progress Solutions\n- **Simple Progress Bar**: Linear progress bar showing completed/total files with percentage, updated via Firebase upload progress callbacks\n- **Dual Progress Display**: Combined file count progress and data size progress bars to show both metrics simultaneously\n- **Animated Progress Ring**: Circular progress indicator with file count overlay and smooth animations for visual appeal\n\n### 3. Individual File Upload Status Solutions\n- **Status Icon System**: Color-coded icons (pending/uploading/completed/failed) next to each file in scrollable list\n- **Expandable Queue View**: Collapsible detailed view showing current file being processed with full queue visible on demand\n- **Real-time List Updates**: Live-updating file list with status badges and progress indicators per file\n\n### 4. Upload Speed Information Solutions\n- **Running Average Display**: Calculate and display MB/s or files/min using rolling window of recent upload times\n- **Dynamic Speed Graph**: Mini-chart showing upload speed over time with current speed highlighted\n- **Contextual Speed Indicators**: Speed display with performance indicators (slow/normal/fast) and estimated completion time\n\n### 5. Pause and Resume Capability Solutions\n- **State-based Control**: Pause button that stops current upload, saves queue state, allows resume from exact position\n- **Graceful Interruption**: Complete current file upload before pausing to avoid partial uploads and data corruption\n- **Background State Persistence**: Save upload progress to localStorage/IndexedDB for resume across browser sessions\n\n### 6. Error Handling and Recovery Solutions\n- **Retry Queue System**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff, manual retry button for persistent failures\n- **Error Detail Modal**: Detailed error information with suggested actions (check connection, file permissions, etc.)\n- **Selective Recovery**: Allow users to skip failed files, retry individual files, or retry all failed files at once\n\n### 7. Duplicate File Handling Solutions\n- **Metadata Logging System**: Store file metadata (original path, name, timestamps) in Firestore even when content is duplicate\n- **Duplicate Reference Tracking**: Create lightweight document references that point to existing file content but preserve unique metadata\n- **Version Management**: Track multiple instances of same content with different metadata as separate \"versions\" of the file\n\n### 8. Interruption Recovery Solutions\n- **Checkpoint System**: Save upload progress at regular intervals, detect incomplete uploads on restart\n- **Browser Session Recovery**: Use beforeunload event and localStorage to detect interrupted uploads and offer resume\n- **Firebase Resume Logic**: Query uploaded files on restart to determine queue position and continue from interruption point\n\n### 9. Thorough and Reliable Bulk Uploading Solutions\n- **Upload Transaction Tracking**: Create upload batch record in Firestore, mark files as uploaded only after successful storage + database write\n- **Atomic Upload Operations**: Ensure both file storage and metadata database writes succeed together or both fail\n- **Upload Verification System**: Post-upload verification that compares uploaded file metadata against original queue for completeness\n\n### 10. Upload Completion Notification Solutions\n- **Success Modal with Summary**: Detailed completion modal showing total files, data uploaded, time elapsed, any issues encountered\n- **Browser Notification**: System notification (if permitted) for completion when user is in different tab/window\n- **Email/Dashboard Summary**: Post-upload summary report saved to user dashboard or optionally emailed\n\n### 11. Failed Upload Summary Solutions\n- **Categorized Error Report**: Group failures by error type (network, permission, size, etc.) with actionable solutions\n- **Downloadable Error Log**: Export detailed error report as CSV/JSON for technical analysis or support\n- **Interactive Failure Review**: Click-through interface to review each failed file with retry options and error details\n\n### 12. Batch Upload Cancellation Solutions\n- **Immediate Stop with Cleanup**: Cancel button that stops all uploads immediately and cleans up partial uploads\n- **Graceful Cancellation**: Complete current file uploads then stop, preserving successfully uploaded files\n- **Confirmation Dialog**: Two-step cancellation (button + confirmation) to prevent accidental cancellation of large uploads\n\n### 13. Post-Upload Detailed Review Solutions\n- **Searchable Upload Results Table**: Sortable, filterable table of all uploaded files with status, errors, metadata\n- **Upload History Dashboard**: Persistent record of upload sessions with drill-down capability for detailed review\n- **File-by-File Inspection**: Modal or detail view for individual file upload results including metadata and any processing notes\n\n### 14. Cleanup and Reset Solutions\n- **Manual Clear Controls**: Separate buttons for \"Clear Completed\", \"Clear All\", \"Clear Failed\" with confirmation dialogs\n- **Automatic Cleanup Options**: User preference settings for auto-clear behavior (immediate, after delay, manual only)\n- **Session-based Reset**: Automatic queue clearing when starting new upload session with option to preserve previous results"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1146,"cache_read_input_tokens":21494,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1146,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1421,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSWrZKUDgY2dbREZ6J999","type":"assistant","uuid":"3d481b56-1105-4943-a537-e8d6bb5c4fc4","timestamp":"2025-08-26T19:15:14.280Z"}
