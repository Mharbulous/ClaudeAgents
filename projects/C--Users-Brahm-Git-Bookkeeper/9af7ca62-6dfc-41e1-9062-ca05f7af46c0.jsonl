Upload Progress Visibility\n**As a user**, when I click \"Start Upload\", **I want** to see immediate visual feedback that the upload process has begun, **so that** I know my action was registered and the system is working.\n\n### 2. Real-Time Upload Progress\n**As a user**, **I want** to see a progress bar or percentage showing how many files have been uploaded versus the total, **so that** I can estimate how long the remaining upload will take.\n\n### 3. Individual File Upload Status\n**As a user**, **I want** to see the status of individual files (uploading, completed, failed) in the queue, **so that** I can identify any problematic files that need attention.\n\n### 4. Upload Speed Information\n**As a user**, **I want** to see the current upload speed (MB/s or files/min), **so that** I can understand if my connection is performing well and estimate completion time.\n\n### 5. Pause and Resume Capability\n**As a user**, **I want** to be able to pause the upload process if needed, **so that** I can manage my bandwidth or stop the process without losing progress.\n\n### 6. Background Processing Continuation\n**As a user**, **I want** the upload to continue even if I navigate to other parts of the application, **so that** I can multitask while the files are being processed.\n\n### 7. Error Handling and Recovery\n**As a user**, when a file fails to upload, **I want** to see clear error messages and have options to retry, **so that** I can resolve issues without restarting the entire process.\n\n### 8. Duplicate File Handling\n**As a user**, when the system encounters files that already exist in storage, **I want** to be notified and given options (skip, overwrite, rename), **so that** I have control over how duplicates are handled.\n\n### 9. Network Interruption Recovery\n**As a user**, if my internet connection is interrupted during upload, **I want** the system to automatically detect and resume when connectivity is restored, **so that** I don't lose upload progress.\n\n### 10. Upload Completion Notification\n**As a user**, when all files have been successfully uploaded, **I want** to receive a clear completion message with a summary of results, **so that** I know the process finished and can see what was accomplished.\n\n### 11. Failed Upload Summary\n**As a user**, after the upload process completes, **I want** to see a summary of any failed uploads with reasons, **so that** I can address issues and retry if needed.\n\n### 12. Storage Usage Update\n**As a user**, after upload completion, **I want** to see my updated storage usage statistics, **so that** I can understand how much space I've used and plan future uploads.\n\n### 13. File Organization Preview\n**As a user**, **I want** to see where my uploaded files will be organized in the system (folders, categories), **so that** I can find them easily later.\n\n### 14. Batch Upload Cancellation\n**As a user**, **I want** the ability to cancel the entire upload process if needed, **so that** I can stop unwanted uploads without waiting for completion.\n\n### 15. Upload History Tracking\n**As a user**, **I want** the system to remember my upload session details, **so that** I can reference what was uploaded and when for future organization or troubleshooting.\n\n## Post-Upload Experience Stories\n\n### 16. Navigation to Uploaded Files\n**As a user**, after upload completion, **I want** quick navigation options to view my newly uploaded files, **so that** I can immediately verify and organize my content.\n\n### 17. Upload Analytics\n**As a user**, **I want** to see statistics about my upload session (total size, time taken, average speed), **so that** I can understand the performance and plan future uploads accordingly.\n\n### 18. Cleanup and Reset\n**As a user**, after reviewing upload results, **I want** the ability to clear the upload queue and start fresh, **so that** I can begin a new upload session without confusion from previous data."}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":260,"cache_read_input_tokens":21759,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":260,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSWfLqiFNbzSRxpLVKRD6","type":"assistant","uuid":"a389e570-21c1-477b-b2bc-6ec8c66277a9","timestamp":"2025-08-26T16:47:50.983Z"}
