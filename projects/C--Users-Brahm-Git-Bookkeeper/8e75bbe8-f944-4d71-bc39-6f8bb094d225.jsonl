This was caused by the CSS `group-focus-within:block` implementation creating a focus trap.\n\n**Solution Implemented**: \n- Completely rebuilt the AppSwitcher component using Material Design 3 principles\n- Replaced CSS-only focus-within approach with proper JavaScript state management\n- Added comprehensive keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape, Home, End)\n- Implemented proper ARIA accessibility attributes and roles\n- Added Material Design 3 elevation shadows and smooth transitions\n- Included click-outside-to-close functionality and mobile-responsive backdrop\n- Enhanced focus management that prevents focus traps and properly restores focus\n\n**Technical Validation**:\n- ✅ Linting passed\n- ✅ Build completed successfully  \n- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality\n- ✅ Focus trap eliminated\n- ✅ Full keyboard accessibility support\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/components/AppSwitcher.vue` (complete rewrite)\n- `src/components/layout/AppSidebar.vue` (integration update)\n\n**Status**: Completed - Material Design 3 compliant dropdown with proper focus management and enhanced user experience\n\n### Step 3 📋 NOT STARTED - Build Front End for File Uploading\n\nUsing Material Design, \ncreate a front end interface for uploading files, with options for bulk uploading using a folder picker, or by dragging and dropping folders into the app, as well as the ability to upload individual files by dragging and dropping, or by open a file picker interface.\n\n**Status**: Not Started - Next step to begin implementation\n\n### Step 4 📋 NOT STARTED - Build Front End Bulk Upload options.\n\nTo enable truly bulk uploads, when uploading folders, check if the folder has subfolders, and ask the user if they want to upload files saved in subfolder, or just the main folder.  Build front end only.   Users should be able to drag and drop folders, or select a folder, and see a popup asking if they want to include files saved in subfolders, but nothing should actually be uploaded.  Not applicable for individual files.\n\n**Status**: Not Started - Pending Step 3 completion\n\n### Step 5 📋 NOT STARTED - Build Front File Upload Queue Preview with duplication detection.\n\nBuild front end only.   Users should be able to drag and drop folders, or select a folder, and after selecting whether to include files saved in subfolders, they should be shown a list of the files that will be uploaded.  This should include a search for any duplicate files using SHA256 hash values.  However when duplicates are found, this fact should not be shared with the user immediately.  Instead, we should then check the upload logs to see whether any previous upload of this file had the exact same meta data.  If a file with the same SHA256 hash exists, but the metadata is different in anyway, then do not indicate that this file has been previously uploaded, because we want the user to upload this variation of the file so that we can log it's meta data without actually uploading it.  If a previous upload with the same SHA 256 hash value, and exactly the same data is found, then display a note next this file indicating \"File previously uploaded by ____________ on _________ date and will be skipped.\"\nIf a previous upload with the same SHA 256 hash value but different meta data is found, then display \"Duplicate file with different meta data was uploaded by ____________ on ________.  Proceed with upload to enable comparison of these similar files.\"  If only one file is being uploaded, then instead of a list of files, display a embedded notification that display for 3-5 seconds before fading away.  The message for single files should be reworded slightly to reflect the fact that only one file upload was attempted, but the meaning should be the same. \n\nDo a similar analysis of files in the upload queue, checking to see if duplicate files are being uploaded.  If files with duplicate SHA 256 values but different meta data are found, then display \"Duplicate files with different meta data detected.  Proceed with upload to enable comparison of these similar files.\"   If files with duplicate SHA 256 and identical meta data is found, then display \"Duplicate files detected.  Only one copy will be uploaded, the other will be skipped.\"\n\nAfter listing the file upload queue, there should be a button for the user to click to be able to proceed with the uploads.  However, if only a single file is being uploaded, and not a folder, then skip the file upload queu display, and immediately attempt the upload, displaying the appropriate notificatoin for 3-5 seconds if a duplicate SHA 256 hash value was detected.  \n\nUse material design for the front end elements as much as possible.\n\n**Status**: Not Started - Pending Steps 3-4 completion\n\n### Step 6 📋 NOT STARTED - Implement Actual File Uploads\n\nOnce the Front End looks good, and user has approved the UI, then start implementing the actual uploads.  \n\nUse the same file upload queue display, and with a progress bar next to each file.  When a file is queued but has not started uploading, instead of a progress bar display the text \"pending\".  For duplicate files with identical hash codes, instead of a progress bar, display the message \"skipped...\" but only after the upload attempt has been logged. For files that are in progress, show a horizontal green progress bar.  For files that have been fully uploaded, show a full green progress bar.\n\nWhen uploading of a particular file starts, add a upload log entry showing that the upload started.  When uploading of a particular file completes successfully, update the same log entry to show that the upload finished.  In this way, if any file upload gets interrupted, we should be able to tell from the logs.\n\nUse material design wherever possible.\n\n**Status**: Not Started - Pending Steps 3-5 completion\n\n---\n\n## Current Progress Summary\n\n- ✅ **Step 1**: Firebase documentation copied from Coryphaeus\n- ✅ **Step 2**: AppSwitcher component verified and configured  \n- ✅ **Step 2.1**: Material Design 3 AppSwitcher enhancement completed\n- 📋 **Step 3**: File upload front end interface (NEXT TO START)\n- 📋 **Step 4**: Bulk upload options with subfolder selection\n- 📋 **Step 5**: Upload queue preview with duplicate detection\n- 📋 **Step 6**: Actual file upload implementation\n\n**Ready to Begin**: Step 3 - Build Front End for File Uploading\n\n\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":38,"oldLines":13,"newStart":38,"newLines":35,"lines":[" "," **Status**: Completed - Material Design 3 compliant dropdown with proper focus management and enhanced user experience"," ","-### Step 3 📋 NOT STARTED - Build Front End for File Uploading","+### Step 3 ✅ COMPLETED - Build Front End for File Uploading"," "," Using Material Design, "," create a front end interface for uploading files, with options for bulk uploading using a folder picker, or by dragging and dropping folders into the app, as well as the ability to upload individual files by dragging and dropping, or by open a file picker interface."," ","-**Status**: Not Started - Next step to begin implementation","+**Status**: Completed - Comprehensive Material Design interface implemented"," ","+**Implementation Details**:","+- ✅ Material Design interface using Vuetify components","+- ✅ Bulk folder uploads with folder picker (`webkitdirectory` attribute)","+- ✅ Full drag & drop support for both files and folders","+- ✅ Individual file upload with file picker interface","+- ✅ Proper drag/drop event handling with visual feedback","+- ✅ File type detection with appropriate Material Design icons","+- ✅ Upload dropzone with hover states and animations","+","+**Files Created**:","+- `src/views/FileUpload.vue` (466 lines) - Main upload interface","+- `src/components/features/upload/FileUploadQueue.vue` (324 lines) - Queue component","+- Router configuration at `/upload` path","+- Sidebar navigation with cloud icon for easy access","+","+**Technical Features**:","+- Comprehensive event handling for drag/drop operations","+- File and folder detection using `webkitGetAsEntry()` API","+- Material Design elevation shadows and smooth transitions","+- Responsive design with mobile-friendly controls","+- Accessibility features and ARIA compliance","+"," ### Step 4 📋 NOT STARTED - Build Front End Bulk Upload options."," "," To enable truly bulk uploads, when uploading folders, check if the folder has subfolders, and ask the user if they want to upload files saved in subfolder, or just the main folder.

This was caused by the CSS `group-focus-within:block` implementation creating a focus trap.\n\n**Solution Implemented**: \n- Completely rebuilt the AppSwitcher component using Material Design 3 principles\n- Replaced CSS-only focus-within approach with proper JavaScript state management\n- Added comprehensive keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape, Home, End)\n- Implemented proper ARIA accessibility attributes and roles\n- Added Material Design 3 elevation shadows and smooth transitions\n- Included click-outside-to-close functionality and mobile-responsive backdrop\n- Enhanced focus management that prevents focus traps and properly restores focus\n\n**Technical Validation**:\n- ✅ Linting passed\n- ✅ Build completed successfully  \n- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality\n- ✅ Focus trap eliminated\n- ✅ Full keyboard accessibility support\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/components/AppSwitcher.vue` (complete rewrite)\n- `src/components/layout/AppSidebar.vue` (integration update)\n\n**Status**: Completed - Material Design 3 compliant dropdown with proper focus management and enhanced user experience\n\n### Step 3 ✅ COMPLETED - Build Front End for File Uploading\n\nUsing Material Design, \ncreate a front end interface for uploading files, with options for bulk uploading using a folder picker, or by dragging and dropping folders into the app, as well as the ability to upload individual files by dragging and dropping, or by open a file picker interface.\n\n**Status**: Completed - Comprehensive Material Design interface implemented\n\n**Implementation Details**:\n- ✅ Material Design interface using Vuetify components\n- ✅ Bulk folder uploads with folder picker (`webkitdirectory` attribute)\n- ✅ Full drag & drop support for both files and folders\n- ✅ Individual file upload with file picker interface\n- ✅ Proper drag/drop event handling with visual feedback\n- ✅ File type detection with appropriate Material Design icons\n- ✅ Upload dropzone with hover states and animations\n\n**Files Created**:\n- `src/views/FileUpload.vue` (466 lines) - Main upload interface\n- `src/components/features/upload/FileUploadQueue.vue` (324 lines) - Queue component\n- Router configuration at `/upload` path\n- Sidebar navigation with cloud icon for easy access\n\n**Technical Features**:\n- Comprehensive event handling for drag/drop operations\n- File and folder detection using `webkitGetAsEntry()` API\n- Material Design elevation shadows and smooth transitions\n- Responsive design with mobile-friendly controls\n- Accessibility features and ARIA compliance\n\n### Step 4 📋 NOT STARTED - Build Front End Bulk Upload options.\n\nTo enable truly bulk uploads, when uploading folders, check if the folder has subfolders, and ask the user if they want to upload files saved in subfolder, or just the main folder.  Build front end only.   Users should be able to drag and drop folders, or select a folder, and see a popup asking if they want to include files saved in subfolders, but nothing should actually be uploaded.  Not applicable for individual files.\n\n**Status**: Not Started - Pending Step 3 completion\n\n### Step 5 📋 NOT STARTED - Build Front File Upload Queue Preview with duplication detection.\n\nBuild front end only.   Users should be able to drag and drop folders, or select a folder, and after selecting whether to include files saved in subfolders, they should be shown a list of the files that will be uploaded.  This should include a search for any duplicate files using SHA256 hash values.  However when duplicates are found, this fact should not be shared with the user immediately.  Instead, we should then check the upload logs to see whether any previous upload of this file had the exact same meta data.  If a file with the same SHA256 hash exists, but the metadata is different in anyway, then do not indicate that this file has been previously uploaded, because we want the user to upload this variation of the file so that we can log it's meta data without actually uploading it.  If a previous upload with the same SHA 256 hash value, and exactly the same data is found, then display a note next this file indicating \"File previously uploaded by ____________ on _________ date and will be skipped.\"\nIf a previous upload with the same SHA 256 hash value but different meta data is found, then display \"Duplicate file with different meta data was uploaded by ____________ on ________.  Proceed with upload to enable comparison of these similar files.\"  If only one file is being uploaded, then instead of a list of files, display a embedded notification that display for 3-5 seconds before fading away.  The message for single files should be reworded slightly to reflect the fact that only one file upload was attempted, but the meaning should be the same. \n\nDo a similar analysis of files in the upload queue, checking to see if duplicate files are being uploaded.  If files with duplicate SHA 256 values but different meta data are found, then display \"Duplicate files with different meta data detected.  Proceed with upload to enable comparison of these similar files.\"   If files with duplicate SHA 256 and identical meta data is found, then display \"Duplicate files detected.  Only one copy will be uploaded, the other will be skipped.\"\n\nAfter listing the file upload queue, there should be a button for the user to click to be able to proceed with the uploads.  However, if only a single file is being uploaded, and not a folder, then skip the file upload queu display, and immediately attempt the upload, displaying the appropriate notificatoin for 3-5 seconds if a duplicate SHA 256 hash value was detected.  \n\nUse material design for the front end elements as much as possible.\n\n**Status**: Not Started - Pending Steps 3-4 completion\n\n### Step 6 📋 NOT STARTED - Implement Actual File Uploads\n\nOnce the Front End looks good, and user has approved the UI, then start implementing the actual uploads.  \n\nUse the same file upload queue display, and with a progress bar next to each file.  When a file is queued but has not started uploading, instead of a progress bar display the text \"pending\".  For duplicate files with identical hash codes, instead of a progress bar, display the message \"skipped...\" but only after the upload attempt has been logged. For files that are in progress, show a horizontal green progress bar.  For files that have been fully uploaded, show a full green progress bar.\n\nWhen uploading of a particular file starts, add a upload log entry showing that the upload started.  When uploading of a particular file completes successfully, update the same log entry to show that the upload finished.  In this way, if any file upload gets interrupted, we should be able to tell from the logs.\n\nUse material design wherever possible.\n\n**Status**: Not Started - Pending Steps 3-5 completion\n\n---\n\n## Current Progress Summary\n\n- ✅ **Step 1**: Firebase documentation copied from Coryphaeus\n- ✅ **Step 2**: AppSwitcher component verified and configured  \n- ✅ **Step 2.1**: Material Design 3 AppSwitcher enhancement completed\n- 📋 **Step 3**: File upload front end interface (NEXT TO START)\n- 📋 **Step 4**: Bulk upload options with subfolder selection\n- 📋 **Step 5**: Upload queue preview with duplicate detection\n- 📋 **Step 6**: Actual file upload implementation\n\n**Ready to Begin**: Step 3 - Build Front End for File Uploading\n\n\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":67,"oldLines":12,"newStart":67,"newLines":29,"lines":[" - Responsive design with mobile-friendly controls"," - Accessibility features and ARIA compliance"," ","-### Step 4 📋 NOT STARTED - Build Front End Bulk Upload options.","+### Step 4 ✅ COMPLETED - Build Front End Bulk Upload options."," "," To enable truly bulk uploads, when uploading folders, check if the folder has subfolders, and ask the user if they want to upload files saved in subfolder, or just the main folder.

Users should be able to drag and drop folders, or select a folder, and after selecting whether to include files saved in subfolders, they should be shown a list of the files that will be uploaded.  This should include a search for any duplicate files using SHA256 hash values.  However when duplicates are found, this fact should not be shared with the user immediately.  Instead, we should then check the upload logs to see whether any previous upload of this file had the exact same meta data.  If a file with the same SHA256 hash exists, but the metadata is different in anyway, then do not indicate that this file has been previously uploaded, because we want the user to upload this variation of the file so that we can log it's meta data without actually uploading it.  If a previous upload with the same SHA 256 hash value, and exactly the same data is found, then display a note next this file indicating \"File previously uploaded by ____________ on _________ date and will be skipped.\"\nIf a previous upload with the same SHA 256 hash value but different meta data is found, then display \"Duplicate file with different meta data was uploaded by ____________ on ________.  Proceed with upload to enable comparison of these similar files.\"  If only one file is being uploaded, then instead of a list of files, display a embedded notification that display for 3-5 seconds before fading away.  The message for single files should be reworded slightly to reflect the fact that only one file upload was attempted, but the meaning should be the same. \n\nDo a similar analysis of files in the upload queue, checking to see if duplicate files are being uploaded.  If files with duplicate SHA 256 values but different meta data are found, then display \"Duplicate files with different meta data detected.  Proceed with upload to enable comparison of these similar files.\"   If files with duplicate SHA 256 and identical meta data is found, then display \"Duplicate files detected.  Only one copy will be uploaded, the other will be skipped.\"\n\nAfter listing the file upload queue, there should be a button for the user to click to be able to proceed with the uploads.  However, if only a single file is being uploaded, and not a folder, then skip the file upload queu display, and immediately attempt the upload, displaying the appropriate notificatoin for 3-5 seconds if a duplicate SHA 256 hash value was detected.  \n\nUse material design for the front end elements as much as possible.\n\n**Status**: Mostly Completed - Core functionality implemented, upload log integration pending\n\n**Implementation Details**:\n- ✅ Material Design upload queue preview using Vuetify components\n- ✅ SHA-256 hash calculation for all uploaded files using Web Crypto API\n- ✅ File list display with comprehensive metadata (size, type, last modified, path)\n- ✅ Material Design file type icons and status indicators\n- ✅ Queue duplicate detection and warning messages\n- ✅ Single file notification system with 3-5 second fade (Vuetify snackbar)\n- ✅ Upload queue management (add, remove, clear all)\n- ✅ File size formatting and date display utilities\n- ✅ Material Design cards, lists, and action buttons\n\n**Implemented Features**:\n- Upload queue display with file details and thumbnails\n- Duplicate file detection within the queue itself\n- Status tracking (pending, uploading, completed, error, skipped)\n- File removal from queue functionality\n- Total size calculation and uploadable file counting\n- Material Design alert for duplicate warnings\n- Proper file path display for folder uploads\n\n**Partially Implemented - Needs Upload Log Integration**:\n- ⚠️ Upload log checking for historical duplicates (placeholder logic in place)\n- ⚠️ \"Previously uploaded by X on Y date\" messaging (framework ready)\n- ⚠️ Metadata comparison for determining exact vs metadata duplicates\n\n**Technical Features**:\n- Comprehensive file info objects with unique IDs\n- Hash-based duplicate detection algorithm\n- Reactive computed properties for queue analysis\n- Material Design component integration\n- Accessibility features and proper labeling\n\n### Step 6 📋 NOT STARTED - Implement Actual File Uploads\n\nOnce the Front End looks good, and user has approved the UI, then start implementing the actual uploads.  \n\nUse the same file upload queue display, and with a progress bar next to each file.  When a file is queued but has not started uploading, instead of a progress bar display the text \"pending\".  For duplicate files with identical hash codes, instead of a progress bar, display the message \"skipped...\" but only after the upload attempt has been logged. For files that are in progress, show a horizontal green progress bar.  For files that have been fully uploaded, show a full green progress bar.\n\nWhen uploading of a particular file starts, add a upload log entry showing that the upload started.  When uploading of a particular file completes successfully, update the same log entry to show that the upload finished.  In this way, if any file upload gets interrupted, we should be able to tell from the logs.\n\nUse material design wherever possible.\n\n**Status**: Not Started - Pending Steps 3-5 completion\n\n---\n\n## Current Progress Summary\n\n- ✅ **Step 1**: Firebase documentation copied from Coryphaeus\n- ✅ **Step 2**: AppSwitcher component verified and configured  \n- ✅ **Step 2.1**: Material Design 3 AppSwitcher enhancement completed\n- 📋 **Step 3**: File upload front end interface (NEXT TO START)\n- 📋 **Step 4**: Bulk upload options with subfolder selection\n- 📋 **Step 5**: Upload queue preview with duplicate detection\n- 📋 **Step 6**: Actual file upload implementation\n\n**Ready to Begin**: Step 3 - Build Front End for File Uploading\n\n\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":154,"oldLines":12,"newStart":154,"newLines":27,"lines":[" - ✅ **Step 1**: Firebase documentation copied from Coryphaeus"," - ✅ **Step 2**: AppSwitcher component verified and configured  "," - ✅ **Step 2.1**: Material Design 3 AppSwitcher enhancement completed","-- 📋 **Step 3**: File upload front end interface (NEXT TO START)","-- 📋 **Step 4**: Bulk upload options with subfolder selection","-- 📋 **Step 5**: Upload queue preview with duplicate detection","-- 📋 **Step 6**: Actual file upload implementation","+- ✅ **Step 3**: File upload front end interface with Material Design (COMPLETED)","+- ✅ **Step 4**: Bulk upload options with subfolder selection dialog (COMPLETED)","+- ✅ **Step 5**: Upload queue preview with duplicate detection (MOSTLY COMPLETED)","+- 📋 **Step 6**: Actual file upload implementation (NEXT TO START)"," ","-**Ready to Begin**: Step 3 - Build Front End for File Uploading","+**Implementation Status**: ","+- **Front-end interface**: Fully functional with comprehensive Material Design UI","+- **File handling**: Complete drag/drop, file picker, and folder support","+- **Queue management**: Full preview with duplicate detection framework","+- **Upload logs integration**: Pending for complete duplicate detection"," ","+**Ready to Begin**: Step 6 - Implement Actual File Uploads"," ","+**Key Achievements**:","+- Comprehensive Material Design interface using Vuetify","+- Full drag & drop functionality for files and folders","+- Subfolder inclusion dialog with user choice options","+- SHA-256 hash calculation for duplicate detection","+- Upload queue preview with file management","+- Single file notification system","+- All components properly integrated into the application"," ","+","+"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}
