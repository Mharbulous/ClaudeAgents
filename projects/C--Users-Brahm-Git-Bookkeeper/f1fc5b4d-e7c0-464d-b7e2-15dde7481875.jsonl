Vuetify's chip component provides built-in accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation. Custom implementations should leverage Composition API with composable patterns for reusability. The recommended pattern includes reactive tag arrays, input validation, and proper event handling for add/remove operations.\n   121→\n   122→**Rollback Mechanism**: Tag functionality can be disabled via feature flag.

Navigation Integration\n- New \"Organizer\" route and navigation item\n- Proper Vue Router integration\n- Route guards for authenticated access\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Data Model\n```javascript\n// Firestore document structure for file metadata\n{\n  id: \"file-hash-id\", // Existing hash-based ID from upload system\n  teamId: \"user-team-id\", // Existing team isolation\n  filename: \"document.pdf\",\n  originalName: \"Original Document Name.pdf\",\n  fileExtension: \".pdf\",\n  uploadDate: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  tags: [\"invoice\", \"2024\", \"client-a\"], // New field for manual tags\n  createdAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  updatedAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"\n}\n```\n\n### Component Structure\n```\nviews/\n  Organizer.vue                 // Main organizer page\ncomponents/features/organizer/\n  FileList.vue                  // File list display component\n  FileListItem.vue              // Individual file row component\n  TagInput.vue                  // Tag input/management component\n  FileFilter.vue                // Search/filter interface\n```\n\n### Store Integration\n```javascript\n// New Pinia store for organizer functionality\nstores/organizer.js\n- fileList: [] // Array of file objects with tags\n- filteredFiles: [] // Computed filtered results\n- filterText: \"\" // Current filter string\n- actions: fetchFiles(), updateFileTags(), filterFiles()\n```\n\n## Existing Codebase Assessment\n\n### Current Organizer Files (Lines of Code)\n- `FileListItem.vue`: 16 lines (skeleton with TODO comments)\n- `FileSearch.vue`: 16 lines (skeleton with TODO comments)  \n- `useFileSearch.js`: 44 lines (partial implementation with basic search logic)\n- Additional skeleton files: `FileGrid.vue`, `FilePreview.vue`, `FileDetails.vue`, `ViewModeToggle.vue`, `FileTypeFilters.vue` (all basic skeletons)\n- Composables: `useFileViewer.js`, `useFilePreview.js`, `useViewerNavigation.js` (skeleton files)\n- Utils: `fileViewerUtils.js`, `previewGenerators.js` (skeleton files)\n\n**Total Existing**: ~15 skeleton files with approximately 200 lines of placeholder code\n\n### Integration Points\n- Existing upload system uses hash-based file identification\n- Firebase Storage already configured and working\n- Authentication system with team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- Vuetify components and styling system established\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Data Layer Setup (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium  \n**Dependencies**: None  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Based on Firebase documentation and 2024 best practices, optimal Firestore collection patterns recommend using lowerCamelCase field names, avoiding sequential document IDs to prevent hotspots, and implementing subcollections for hierarchical data. For file metadata, the recommendation is to denormalize data for query performance while keeping documents under 1MB. The pattern of using hash-based IDs (already implemented in upload system) aligns with best practices for avoiding monotonically increasing IDs that can cause latency issues.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: All data model changes are additive only. New `tags` field can be removed from existing documents without breaking upload functionality. Firestore security rules can be reverted to previous state if needed.\n\n- [ ] Create Firestore collection structure for file metadata\n- [ ] Implement data migration from existing upload system  \n- [ ] Create Pinia store for organizer state management\n- [ ] Add Firestore security rules for organizer data access\n\n### Step 2: Core Components (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1 (data layer)  \n\n- [ ] Enhance existing `Organizer.vue` view component  \n- [ ] Build `FileList.vue` component for displaying files\n- [ ] Complete implementation of existing `FileListItem.vue` skeleton (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Create `TagInput.vue` component for tag management\n\n### Step 3: Tag Management System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium\n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 2  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Vue 3 tag input best practices for 2024 recommend using established UI libraries (PrimeVue, Vuetify, Shadcn/Vue) for production applications. Vuetify's chip component provides built-in accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation. Custom implementations should leverage Composition API with composable patterns for reusability. The recommended pattern includes reactive tag arrays, input validation, and proper event handling for add/remove operations.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Tag functionality can be disabled via feature flag. Firestore writes for tags can be wrapped in try/catch with rollback to previous tag state on failure.\n\n- [ ] Implement tag input interface with add/remove functionality\n- [ ] Create tag display with visual indicators using Vuetify chips\n- [ ] Add tag persistence to Firestore\n- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates for tag changes\n\n### Step 4: Search and Filter (Low Complexity)  \n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low\n**Dependencies**: Step 2, Step 3  \n\n- [ ] Complete existing `FileSearch.vue` skeleton component (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Enhance existing `useFileSearch.js` composable (currently 44 lines with basic logic)\n- [ ] Implement real-time filtering logic in store\n- [ ] Add filter state management and persistence\n\n### Step 5: Navigation and Routing (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 2\n\n- [ ] Add \"Organizer\" route to Vue Router configuration\n- [ ] Update navigation sidebar with Organizer link  \n- [ ] Implement route guards for authentication\n- [ ] Add proper page titles and meta information\n\n### Step 6: Integration with Existing System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: High  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 5  \n**Internet Research Summary**: VueFire (official Vue.js Firebase bindings) provides the recommended 2024 approach for Firebase Storage integration with Vue 3. The `useStorageFile()`, `useStorageFileUrl()`, and `useStorageFileMetadata()` composables offer reactive bindings that automatically sync metadata changes. The pattern involves importing composables from VueFire and using reactive references for file operations, which aligns with our existing Firebase setup.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Integration changes can be isolated behind feature flags. Existing upload functionality remains unchanged. If metadata sync fails, system falls back to upload-only mode. Database queries can be reverted to original upload system patterns.\n\n- [ ] Connect to existing Firebase storage system using VueFire patterns\n- [ ] Leverage existing file upload metadata without breaking current functionality\n- [ ] Ensure team-based data isolation maintains existing security model\n- [ ] Test integration with existing authentication system\n\n### Step 7: Testing and Polish (Medium Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: All previous steps  \n\n- [ ] Write unit tests for new components  \n- [ ] Add E2E tests for organizer workflow\n- [ ] Test with large file collections\n- [ ] Performance optimization and loading states\n\n## File Structure\n\n### Files to Enhance (Already Exist as Skeletons)\n```\nsrc/features/organizer/\n├── components/\n│   ├── FileListItem.vue (16 lines → enhance)\n│   ├── FileSearch.vue (16 lines → enhance)  \n│   ├── FileGrid.vue (skeleton → enhance for list view)\n│   └── FileDetails.vue (skeleton → enhance for tag display)\n├── composables/\n│   ├── useFileSearch.js (44 lines → enhance)\n│   └── useFileViewer.js (skeleton → enhance)\n└── views/\n    └── FileViewer.vue (skeleton → repurpose as main Organizer view)\n```\n\n### New Files to Create\n```\nsrc/features/organizer/\n├── components/\n│   └── TagInput.vue (new)\n├── stores/\n│   └── organizer.js (new)\n├── services/\n│   └── organizerService.js (new)\n└── composables/\n    └── useOrganizer.js (new)\n```\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Layout Structure\n- Header with search/filter bar\n- Main content area with file list table\n- Each row shows: filename, file type icon, upload date, tags, actions\n- Tag display as small chips/badges\n- Inline tag editing capability\n\n### Vuetify Components\n- `v-data-table` or `v-list` for file listing\n- `v-chip` for tag display\n- `v-text-field` for search and tag input\n- `v-icon` for file type indicators\n- `v-card` for overall layout container\n\n## Data Flow\n\n1. **File Loading**: Organizer store fetches file metadata from Firestore on mount\n2. **Tag Assignment**: User clicks tag input → opens inline editor → saves to Firestore → updates local state\n3. **Filtering**: User types in search → store computes filtered results → UI updates reactively\n4. **Tag Management**: Add/remove tags → optimistic UI update → Firestore write → error handling\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Store actions and getters\n- Component prop handling and events\n- Tag input validation and formatting\n- Filter logic correctness\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Firestore data operations\n- Authentication integration\n- Route navigation and guards\n- Cross-component data flow\n\n### E2E Tests\n- Complete organizer workflow\n- Tag assignment and search\n- Integration with existing upload system\n- Performance with multiple files\n\n## Single Source of Truth Compliance\n\n### Data Architecture\n- **Primary Source**: Existing upload system hash-based file identification remains authoritative\n- **Metadata Extension**: Tags stored as additional field in existing file documents, not separate collection\n- **Firestore Integration**: Leverages existing file metadata structure to avoid duplication\n- **No Data Duplication**: Tag data extends existing documents rather than creating parallel storage\n\n### Reference Integration\n- File metadata continues using existing Firebase Storage references\n- Tag data stored in same Firestore documents as existing upload metadata\n- Upload system remains unchanged and authoritative for file operations\n- Organizer reads from single source rather than creating separate data stores\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Initial Implementation (v1.0 Scope Only)\n- Simple approach suitable for moderate file collections (100-1000 files)\n- Client-side filtering for responsive UI\n- Basic loading states during data fetch\n- **No premature optimization** - defer performance enhancements to later versions\n\n### Explicitly Deferred to Future Versions\n- Virtual scrolling for large collections (planned for v1.9)\n- Server-side filtering for very large datasets  \n- Lazy loading of file metadata\n- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data\n\n## Security Requirements\n\n### Firestore Rules\n```javascript\n// Ensure users can only access their own team's files\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /fileMetadata/{fileId} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth != null \n        && resource.data.teamId == request.auth.uid;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Data Validation\n- Sanitize tag input to prevent XSS\n- Validate file access permissions\n- Ensure team isolation in all operations\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Existing Systems\n- **Upload System**: Leverage existing file metadata and hash-based deduplication\n- **Authentication**: Use existing team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- **Storage**: Connect to existing Firebase Storage for file access\n- **Routing**: Integrate with existing Vue Router and navigation\n\n### Future Versions\n- Tag structure extensible to category-based system (v1.1)\n- Component architecture supports AI integration (v1.3)\n- Data model compatible with confidence scoring (v1.4)\n- UI framework supports virtual folder views (v1.2)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### Functional Requirements\n- [ ] Users can view all uploaded files in organized list\n- [ ] Users can assign text-based tags to any file\n- [ ] Users can search/filter files by tag text\n- [ ] System maintains existing upload functionality\n- [ ] All operations respect team-based data isolation\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- [ ] File list loads within 2 seconds for 100 files\n- [ ] Tag filtering responds within 500ms\n- [ ] Tag assignment saves within 1 second\n- [ ] UI remains responsive during all operations\n\n### User Experience Requirements\n- [ ] Intuitive interface requiring minimal learning\n- [ ] Consistent with existing application design patterns\n- [ ] Clear visual feedback for all user actions\n- [ ] Graceful error handling and recovery\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Technical Risks\n- **Large File Collections**: Start with client-side filtering, monitor performance\n- **Concurrent Tag Updates**: Implement optimistic updates with rollback capability\n- **Firestore Costs**: Monitor query patterns and implement pagination if needed\n\n### User Experience Risks\n- **Feature Discoverability**: Clear navigation and introductory help text\n- **Tag Management Complexity**: Keep v1.0 simple, defer advanced features to later versions\n- **Data Migration**: Ensure existing uploaded files are properly indexed\n\n## Documentation Requirements\n\n### Developer Documentation\n- Component API documentation\n- Store structure and actions\n- Data model and relationships\n- Testing guidelines and examples\n\n### User Documentation\n- Feature introduction and benefits\n- Step-by-step usage guide\n- Tag best practices\n- Integration with existing workflow\n\n## Deployment Strategy\n\n### Development Phases\n1. **Local Development**: Build and test all components in isolation\n2. **Integration Testing**: Test with existing system on development Firebase\n3. **User Acceptance Testing**: Deploy to staging environment for feedback\n4. **Production Deployment**: Roll out with feature flag capability\n\n### Rollback Plan\n- Feature toggle for organizer navigation item\n- Database schema changes are additive only\n- Component lazy loading allows graceful fallback\n- Separate service worker for organizer-specific functionality\n\n## Timeline Estimation\n\n### Week 1: Foundation\n- Data model design and Firestore setup\n- Basic component structure\n- Store implementation and integration\n\n### Week 2: Core Features\n- File list display and tag input\n- Basic search/filter functionality\n- Navigation integration\n\n### Week 3: Polish and Testing\n- UI refinement and responsive design\n- Comprehensive testing suite\n- Performance optimization and error handling\n\n### Total Estimated Duration: 3 weeks\n\nThis implementation plan provides the foundation for all future Organizer versions while delivering immediate value through manual document organization capabilities.","numLines":384,"startLine":1,"totalLines":384}}}

Vuetify's chip component provides built-in accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation. Custom implementations should leverage Composition API with composable patterns for reusability. The recommended pattern includes reactive tag arrays, input validation, and proper event handling for add/remove operations.\n   121→\n   122→**Rollback Mechanism**: Tag functionality can be disabled via feature flag.

For file metadata, the recommendation is to denormalize data for query performance while keeping documents under 1MB. The pattern of using hash-based IDs (already implemented in upload system) aligns with best practices for avoiding monotonically increasing IDs that can cause latency issues.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: All data model changes are additive only. New `tags` field can be removed from existing documents without breaking upload functionality. Firestore security rules can be reverted to previous state if needed.\n\n- [ ] Create Firestore collection structure for file metadata\n- [ ] Implement data migration from existing upload system  \n- [ ] Create Pinia store for organizer state management\n- [ ] Add Firestore security rules for organizer data access\n\n### Step 2: Core Components (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1 (data layer)  \n\n- [ ] Enhance existing `Organizer.vue` view component  \n- [ ] Build `FileList.vue` component for displaying files\n- [ ] Complete implementation of existing `FileListItem.vue` skeleton (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Create `TagInput.vue` component for tag management\n\n### Step 3: Tag Management System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium\n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 2  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Vue 3 tag input best practices for 2024 recommend using established UI libraries (PrimeVue, Vuetify, Shadcn/Vue) for production applications. Vuetify's chip component provides built-in accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation. Custom implementations should leverage Composition API with composable patterns for reusability. The recommended pattern includes reactive tag arrays, input validation, and proper event handling for add/remove operations.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Tag functionality can be disabled via feature flag. Firestore writes for tags can be wrapped in try/catch with rollback to previous tag state on failure.\n\n- [ ] Implement tag input interface with add/remove functionality\n- [ ] Create tag display with visual indicators using Vuetify chips\n- [ ] Add tag persistence to Firestore\n- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates for tag changes\n\n### Step 4: Search and Filter (Low Complexity)  \n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low\n**Dependencies**: Step 2, Step 3  \n\n- [ ] Complete existing `FileSearch.vue` skeleton component (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Enhance existing `useFileSearch.js` composable (currently 44 lines with basic logic)\n- [ ] Implement real-time filtering logic in store\n- [ ] Add filter state management and persistence\n\n### Step 5: Navigation and Routing (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 2\n\n- [ ] Add \"Organizer\" route to Vue Router configuration\n- [ ] Update navigation sidebar with Organizer link  \n- [ ] Implement route guards for authentication\n- [ ] Add proper page titles and meta information\n\n### Step 6: Integration with Existing System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: High  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 5  \n**Internet Research Summary**: VueFire (official Vue.js Firebase bindings) provides the recommended 2024 approach for Firebase Storage integration with Vue 3. The `useStorageFile()`, `useStorageFileUrl()`, and `useStorageFileMetadata()` composables offer reactive bindings that automatically sync metadata changes. The pattern involves importing composables from VueFire and using reactive references for file operations, which aligns with our existing Firebase setup.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Integration changes can be isolated behind feature flags. Existing upload functionality remains unchanged. If metadata sync fails, system falls back to upload-only mode. Database queries can be reverted to original upload system patterns.\n\n- [ ] Connect to existing Firebase storage system using VueFire patterns\n- [ ] Leverage existing file upload metadata without breaking current functionality\n- [ ] Ensure team-based data isolation maintains existing security model\n- [ ] Test integration with existing authentication system\n\n### Step 7: Testing and Polish (Medium Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: All previous steps  \n\n- [ ] Write unit tests for new components  \n- [ ] Add E2E tests for organizer workflow\n- [ ] Test with large file collections\n- [ ] Performance optimization and loading states\n\n## File Structure\n\n### Files to Enhance (Already Exist as Skeletons)\n```\nsrc/features/organizer/\n├── components/\n│   ├── FileListItem.vue (16 lines → enhance)\n│   ├── FileSearch.vue (16 lines → enhance)  \n│   ├── FileGrid.vue (skeleton → enhance for list view)\n│   └── FileDetails.vue (skeleton → enhance for tag display)\n├── composables/\n│   ├── useFileSearch.js (44 lines → enhance)\n│   └── useFileViewer.js (skeleton → enhance)\n└── views/\n    └── FileViewer.vue (skeleton → repurpose as main Organizer view)\n```\n\n### New Files to Create\n```\nsrc/features/organizer/\n├── components/\n│   └── TagInput.vue (new)\n├── stores/\n│   └── organizer.js (new)\n├── services/\n│   └── organizerService.js (new)\n└── composables/\n    └── useOrganizer.js (new)\n```\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Layout Structure\n- Header with search/filter bar\n- Main content area with file list table\n- Each row shows: filename, file type icon, upload date, tags, actions\n- Tag display as small chips/badges\n- Inline tag editing capability\n\n### Vuetify Components\n- `v-data-table` or `v-list` for file listing\n- `v-chip` for tag display\n- `v-text-field` for search and tag input\n- `v-icon` for file type indicators\n- `v-card` for overall layout container\n\n## Data Flow\n\n1. **File Loading**: Organizer store fetches file metadata from Firestore on mount\n2. **Tag Assignment**: User clicks tag input → opens inline editor → saves to Firestore → updates local state\n3. **Filtering**: User types in search → store computes filtered results → UI updates reactively\n4. **Tag Management**: Add/remove tags → optimistic UI update → Firestore write → error handling\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Store actions and getters\n- Component prop handling and events\n- Tag input validation and formatting\n- Filter logic correctness\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Firestore data operations\n- Authentication integration\n- Route navigation and guards\n- Cross-component data flow\n\n### E2E Tests\n- Complete organizer workflow\n- Tag assignment and search\n- Integration with existing upload system\n- Performance with multiple files\n\n## Single Source of Truth Compliance\n\n### Data Architecture\n- **Primary Source**: Existing upload system hash-based file identification remains authoritative\n- **Metadata Extension**: Tags stored as additional field in existing file documents, not separate collection\n- **Firestore Integration**: Leverages existing file metadata structure to avoid duplication\n- **No Data Duplication**: Tag data extends existing documents rather than creating parallel storage\n\n### Reference Integration\n- File metadata continues using existing Firebase Storage references\n- Tag data stored in same Firestore documents as existing upload metadata\n- Upload system remains unchanged and authoritative for file operations\n- Organizer reads from single source rather than creating separate data stores\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Initial Implementation (v1.0 Scope Only)\n- Simple approach suitable for moderate file collections (100-1000 files)\n- Client-side filtering for responsive UI\n- Basic loading states during data fetch\n- **No premature optimization** -

Files exist only as an unstructured list from the upload system, making document discovery time-consuming and inefficient, particularly for legal professionals who need to quickly locate specific documents among hundreds or thousands of uploaded files.\n\n### Solution Overview\nImplement a basic file listing interface with manual tag assignment capability, providing users with fundamental document organization through text-based tags and simple search functionality.\n\n## Core Goal\n\nCreate a simple file list view with manual tag assignment capability, providing users with basic document organization through text-based tags.\n\n## Features to Implement\n\n### 1. Basic File List View\n- Display all uploaded files with metadata (filename, extension, upload date)\n- Integration with existing Firebase storage system\n- Simple table/list interface using Vuetify components\n\n### 2. Manual Tag Assignment\n- Tag input interface for each file (text-based input)\n- Tags stored as array of strings in Firestore\n- Ability to add/remove tags per file\n\n### 3. Basic Search/Filter\n- Text-based filtering by tag names\n- Simple search interface at top of file list\n- Real-time filtering as user types\n\n### 4. Navigation Integration\n- New \"Organizer\" route and navigation item\n- Proper Vue Router integration\n- Route guards for authenticated access\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Data Model\n```javascript\n// Firestore document structure for file metadata\n{\n  id: \"file-hash-id\", // Existing hash-based ID from upload system\n  teamId: \"user-team-id\", // Existing team isolation\n  filename: \"document.pdf\",\n  originalName: \"Original Document Name.pdf\",\n  fileExtension: \".pdf\",\n  uploadDate: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  tags: [\"invoice\", \"2024\", \"client-a\"], // New field for manual tags\n  createdAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  updatedAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"\n}\n```\n\n### Component Structure\n```\nviews/\n  Organizer.vue                 // Main organizer page\ncomponents/features/organizer/\n  FileList.vue                  // File list display component\n  FileListItem.vue              // Individual file row component\n  TagInput.vue                  // Tag input/management component\n  FileFilter.vue                // Search/filter interface\n```\n\n### Store Integration\n```javascript\n// New Pinia store for organizer functionality\nstores/organizer.js\n- fileList: [] // Array of file objects with tags\n- filteredFiles: [] // Computed filtered results\n- filterText: \"\" // Current filter string\n- actions: fetchFiles(), updateFileTags(), filterFiles()\n```\n\n## Existing Codebase Assessment\n\n### Current Organizer Files (Lines of Code)\n- `FileListItem.vue`: 16 lines (skeleton with TODO comments)\n- `FileSearch.vue`: 16 lines (skeleton with TODO comments)  \n- `useFileSearch.js`: 44 lines (partial implementation with basic search logic)\n- Additional skeleton files: `FileGrid.vue`, `FilePreview.vue`, `FileDetails.vue`, `ViewModeToggle.vue`, `FileTypeFilters.vue` (all basic skeletons)\n- Composables: `useFileViewer.js`, `useFilePreview.js`, `useViewerNavigation.js` (skeleton files)\n- Utils: `fileViewerUtils.js`, `previewGenerators.js` (skeleton files)\n\n**Total Existing**: ~15 skeleton files with approximately 200 lines of placeholder code\n\n### Integration Points\n- Existing upload system uses hash-based file identification\n- Firebase Storage already configured and working\n- Authentication system with team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- Vuetify components and styling system established\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Data Layer Setup (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium  \n**Dependencies**: None  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Based on Firebase documentation and 2024 best practices, optimal Firestore collection patterns recommend using lowerCamelCase field names, avoiding sequential document IDs to prevent hotspots, and implementing subcollections for hierarchical data. For file metadata, the recommendation is to denormalize data for query performance while keeping documents under 1MB. The pattern of using hash-based IDs (already implemented in upload system) aligns with best practices for avoiding monotonically increasing IDs that can cause latency issues.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: All data model changes are additive only. New `tags` field can be removed from existing documents without breaking upload functionality. Firestore security rules can be reverted to previous state if needed.\n\n- [ ] Create Firestore collection structure for file metadata\n- [ ] Implement data migration from existing upload system  \n- [ ] Create Pinia store for organizer state management\n- [ ] Add Firestore security rules for organizer data access\n\n### Step 2: Core Components (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1 (data layer)  \n\n- [ ] Enhance existing `Organizer.vue` view component  \n- [ ] Build `FileList.vue` component for displaying files\n- [ ] Complete implementation of existing `FileListItem.vue` skeleton (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Create `TagInput.vue` component for tag management\n\n### Step 3: Tag Management System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium\n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 2  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Vue 3 tag input best practices for 2024 recommend using established UI libraries (PrimeVue, Vuetify, Shadcn/Vue) for production applications. Vuetify's chip component provides built-in accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation. Custom implementations should leverage Composition API with composable patterns for reusability. The recommended pattern includes reactive tag arrays, input validation, and proper event handling for add/remove operations.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Tag functionality can be disabled via feature flag. Firestore writes for tags can be wrapped in try/catch with rollback to previous tag state on failure.\n\n- [ ] Implement tag input interface with add/remove functionality\n- [ ] Create tag display with visual indicators using Vuetify chips\n- [ ] Add tag persistence to Firestore\n- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates for tag changes\n\n### Step 4: Search and Filter (Low Complexity)  \n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low\n**Dependencies**: Step 2, Step 3  \n\n- [ ] Complete existing `FileSearch.vue` skeleton component (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Enhance existing `useFileSearch.js` composable (currently 44 lines with basic logic)\n- [ ] Implement real-time filtering logic in store\n- [ ] Add filter state management and persistence\n\n### Step 5: Navigation and Routing (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 2\n\n- [ ] Add \"Organizer\" route to Vue Router configuration\n- [ ] Update navigation sidebar with Organizer link  \n- [ ] Implement route guards for authentication\n- [ ] Add proper page titles and meta information\n\n### Step 6: Integration with Existing System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: High  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 5  \n**Internet Research Summary**: VueFire (official Vue.js Firebase bindings) provides the recommended 2024 approach for Firebase Storage integration with Vue 3. The `useStorageFile()`, `useStorageFileUrl()`, and `useStorageFileMetadata()` composables offer reactive bindings that automatically sync metadata changes. The pattern involves importing composables from VueFire and using reactive references for file operations, which aligns with our existing Firebase setup.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Integration changes can be isolated behind feature flags. Existing upload functionality remains unchanged. If metadata sync fails, system falls back to upload-only mode. Database queries can be reverted to original upload system patterns.\n\n- [ ] Connect to existing Firebase storage system using VueFire patterns\n- [ ] Leverage existing file upload metadata without breaking current functionality\n- [ ] Ensure team-based data isolation maintains existing security model\n- [ ] Test integration with existing authentication system\n\n### Step 7: Testing and Polish (Medium Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: All previous steps  \n\n- [ ] Write unit tests for new components  \n- [ ] Add E2E tests for organizer workflow\n- [ ] Test with large file collections\n- [ ] Performance optimization and loading states\n\n## File Structure\n\n### Files to Enhance (Already Exist as Skeletons)\n```\nsrc/features/organizer/\n├── components/\n│   ├── FileListItem.vue (16 lines → enhance)\n│   ├── FileSearch.vue (16 lines → enhance)  \n│   ├── FileGrid.vue (skeleton → enhance for list view)\n│   └── FileDetails.vue (skeleton → enhance for tag display)\n├── composables/\n│   ├── useFileSearch.js (44 lines → enhance)\n│   └── useFileViewer.js (skeleton → enhance)\n└── views/\n    └── FileViewer.vue (skeleton → repurpose as main Organizer view)\n```\n\n### New Files to Create\n```\nsrc/features/organizer/\n├── components/\n│   └── TagInput.vue (new)\n├── stores/\n│   └── organizer.js (new)\n├── services/\n│   └── organizerService.js (new)\n└── composables/\n    └── useOrganizer.js (new)\n```\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Layout Structure\n- Header with search/filter bar\n- Main content area with file list table\n- Each row shows: filename, file type icon, upload date, tags, actions\n- Tag display as small chips/badges\n- Inline tag editing capability\n\n### Vuetify Components\n- `v-data-table` or `v-list` for file listing\n- `v-chip` for tag display\n- `v-text-field` for search and tag input\n- `v-icon` for file type indicators\n- `v-card` for overall layout container\n\n## Data Flow\n\n1. **File Loading**: Organizer store fetches file metadata from Firestore on mount\n2. **Tag Assignment**: User clicks tag input → opens inline editor → saves to Firestore → updates local state\n3. **Filtering**: User types in search → store computes filtered results → UI updates reactively\n4. **Tag Management**: Add/remove tags → optimistic UI update → Firestore write → error handling\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Store actions and getters\n- Component prop handling and events\n- Tag input validation and formatting\n- Filter logic correctness\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Firestore data operations\n- Authentication integration\n- Route navigation and guards\n- Cross-component data flow\n\n### E2E Tests\n- Complete organizer workflow\n- Tag assignment and search\n- Integration with existing upload system\n- Performance with multiple files\n\n## Single Source of Truth Compliance\n\n### Data Architecture\n- **Primary Source**: Existing upload system hash-based file identification remains authoritative\n- **Metadata Extension**: Tags stored as additional field in existing file documents, not separate collection\n- **Firestore Integration**: Leverages existing file metadata structure to avoid duplication\n- **No Data Duplication**: Tag data extends existing documents rather than creating parallel storage\n\n### Reference Integration\n- File metadata continues using existing Firebase Storage references\n- Tag data stored in same Firestore documents as existing upload metadata\n- Upload system remains unchanged and authoritative for file operations\n- Organizer reads from single source rather than creating separate data stores\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Initial Implementation (v1.0 Scope Only)\n- Simple approach suitable for moderate file collections (100-1000 files)\n- Client-side filtering for responsive UI\n- Basic loading states during data fetch\n- **No premature optimization** - defer performance enhancements to later versions\n\n### Explicitly Deferred to Future Versions\n- Virtual scrolling for large collections (planned for v1.9)\n- Server-side filtering for very large datasets  \n- Lazy loading of file metadata\n- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data\n\n## Security Requirements\n\n### Firestore Rules\n```javascript\n// Ensure users can only access their own team's files\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /fileMetadata/{fileId} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth != null \n        && resource.data.teamId == request.auth.uid;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Data Validation\n- Sanitize tag input to prevent XSS\n- Validate file access permissions\n- Ensure team isolation in all operations\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Existing Systems\n- **Upload System**: Leverage existing file metadata and hash-based deduplication\n- **Authentication**: Use existing team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- **Storage**: Connect to existing Firebase Storage for file access\n- **Routing**: Integrate with existing Vue Router and navigation\n\n### Future Versions\n- Tag structure extensible to category-based system (v1.1)\n- Component architecture supports AI integration (v1.3)\n- Data model compatible with confidence scoring (v1.4)\n- UI framework supports virtual folder views (v1.2)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### Functional Requirements\n- [ ] Users can view all uploaded files in organized list\n- [ ] Users can assign text-based tags to any file\n- [ ] Users can search/filter files by tag text\n- [ ] System maintains existing upload functionality\n- [ ] All operations respect team-based data isolation\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- [ ] File list loads within 2 seconds for 100 files\n- [ ] Tag filtering responds within 500ms\n- [ ] Tag assignment saves within 1 second\n- [ ] UI remains responsive during all operations\n\n### User Experience Requirements\n- [ ] Intuitive interface requiring minimal learning\n- [ ] Consistent with existing application design patterns\n- [ ] Clear visual feedback for all user actions\n- [ ] Graceful error handling and recovery\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Technical Risks\n- **Large File Collections**: Start with client-side filtering, monitor performance\n- **Concurrent Tag Updates**: Implement optimistic updates with rollback capability\n- **Firestore Costs**: Monitor query patterns and implement pagination if needed\n\n### User Experience Risks\n- **Feature Discoverability**: Clear navigation and introductory help text\n- **Tag Management Complexity**: Keep v1.0 simple, defer advanced features to later versions\n- **Data Migration**: Ensure existing uploaded files are properly indexed\n\n## Documentation Requirements\n\n### Developer Documentation\n- Component API documentation\n- Store structure and actions\n- Data model and relationships\n- Testing guidelines and examples\n\n### User Documentation\n- Feature introduction and benefits\n- Step-by-step usage guide\n- Tag best practices\n- Integration with existing workflow\n\n## Deployment Strategy\n\n### Development Phases\n1. **Local Development**: Build and test all components in isolation\n2. **Integration Testing**: Test with existing system on development Firebase\n3. **User Acceptance Testing**: Deploy to staging environment for feedback\n4. **Production Deployment**: Roll out with feature flag capability\n\n### Rollback Plan\n- Feature toggle for organizer navigation item\n- Database schema changes are additive only\n- Component lazy loading allows graceful fallback\n- Separate service worker for organizer-specific functionality\n\n## Timeline Estimation\n\n### Week 1: Foundation\n- Data model design and Firestore setup\n- Basic component structure\n- Store implementation and integration\n\n### Week 2: Core Features\n- File list display and tag input\n- Basic search/filter functionality\n- Navigation integration\n\n### Week 3: Polish and Testing\n- UI refinement and responsive design\n- Comprehensive testing suite\n- Performance optimization and error handling\n\n### Total Estimated Duration: 3 weeks\n\nThis implementation plan provides the foundation for all future Organizer versions while delivering immediate value through manual document organization capabilities.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":287,"oldLines":6,"newStart":287,"newLines":18,"lines":[" -

Files exist only as an unstructured list from the upload system, making document discovery time-consuming and inefficient, particularly for legal professionals who need to quickly locate specific documents among hundreds or thousands of uploaded files.\n\n### Solution Overview\nImplement a basic file listing interface with manual tag assignment capability, providing users with fundamental document organization through text-based tags and simple search functionality.\n\n## Core Goal\n\nCreate a simple file list view with manual tag assignment capability, providing users with basic document organization through text-based tags.\n\n## Features to Implement\n\n### 1. Basic File List View\n- Display all uploaded files with metadata (filename, extension, upload date)\n- Integration with existing Firebase storage system\n- Simple table/list interface using Vuetify components\n\n### 2. Manual Tag Assignment\n- Tag input interface for each file (text-based input)\n- Tags stored as array of strings in Firestore\n- Ability to add/remove tags per file\n\n### 3. Basic Search/Filter\n- Text-based filtering by tag names\n- Simple search interface at top of file list\n- Real-time filtering as user types\n\n### 4. Navigation Integration\n- New \"Organizer\" route and navigation item\n- Proper Vue Router integration\n- Route guards for authenticated access\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Data Model\n```javascript\n// Firestore document structure for file metadata\n{\n  id: \"file-hash-id\", // Existing hash-based ID from upload system\n  teamId: \"user-team-id\", // Existing team isolation\n  filename: \"document.pdf\",\n  originalName: \"Original Document Name.pdf\",\n  fileExtension: \".pdf\",\n  uploadDate: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  tags: [\"invoice\", \"2024\", \"client-a\"], // New field for manual tags\n  createdAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  updatedAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"\n}\n```\n\n### Component Structure\n```\nviews/\n  Organizer.vue                 // Main organizer page\ncomponents/features/organizer/\n  FileList.vue                  // File list display component\n  FileListItem.vue              // Individual file row component\n  TagInput.vue                  // Tag input/management component\n  FileFilter.vue                // Search/filter interface\n```\n\n### Store Integration\n```javascript\n// New Pinia store for organizer functionality\nstores/organizer.js\n- fileList: [] // Array of file objects with tags\n- filteredFiles: [] // Computed filtered results\n- filterText: \"\" // Current filter string\n- actions: fetchFiles(), updateFileTags(), filterFiles()\n```\n\n## Existing Codebase Assessment\n\n### Current Organizer Files (Lines of Code)\n- `FileListItem.vue`: 16 lines (skeleton with TODO comments)\n- `FileSearch.vue`: 16 lines (skeleton with TODO comments)  \n- `useFileSearch.js`: 44 lines (partial implementation with basic search logic)\n- Additional skeleton files: `FileGrid.vue`, `FilePreview.vue`, `FileDetails.vue`, `ViewModeToggle.vue`, `FileTypeFilters.vue` (all basic skeletons)\n- Composables: `useFileViewer.js`, `useFilePreview.js`, `useViewerNavigation.js` (skeleton files)\n- Utils: `fileViewerUtils.js`, `previewGenerators.js` (skeleton files)\n\n**Total Existing**: ~15 skeleton files with approximately 200 lines of placeholder code\n\n### Integration Points\n- Existing upload system uses hash-based file identification\n- Firebase Storage already configured and working\n- Authentication system with team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- Vuetify components and styling system established\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Data Layer Setup (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium  \n**Dependencies**: None  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Based on Firebase documentation and 2024 best practices, optimal Firestore collection patterns recommend using lowerCamelCase field names, avoiding sequential document IDs to prevent hotspots, and implementing subcollections for hierarchical data. For file metadata, the recommendation is to denormalize data for query performance while keeping documents under 1MB. The pattern of using hash-based IDs (already implemented in upload system) aligns with best practices for avoiding monotonically increasing IDs that can cause latency issues.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: All data model changes are additive only. New `tags` field can be removed from existing documents without breaking upload functionality. Firestore security rules can be reverted to previous state if needed.\n\n- [ ] Create Firestore collection structure for file metadata\n- [ ] Implement data migration from existing upload system  \n- [ ] Create Pinia store for organizer state management\n- [ ] Add Firestore security rules for organizer data access\n\n### Step 2: Core Components (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1 (data layer)  \n\n- [ ] Enhance existing `Organizer.vue` view component  \n- [ ] Build `FileList.vue` component for displaying files\n- [ ] Complete implementation of existing `FileListItem.vue` skeleton (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Create `TagInput.vue` component for tag management\n\n### Step 3: Tag Management System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium\n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 2  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Vue 3 tag input best practices for 2024 recommend using established UI libraries (PrimeVue, Vuetify, Shadcn/Vue) for production applications. Vuetify's chip component provides built-in accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation. Custom implementations should leverage Composition API with composable patterns for reusability. The recommended pattern includes reactive tag arrays, input validation, and proper event handling for add/remove operations.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Tag functionality can be disabled via feature flag. Firestore writes for tags can be wrapped in try/catch with rollback to previous tag state on failure.\n\n- [ ] Implement tag input interface with add/remove functionality\n- [ ] Create tag display with visual indicators using Vuetify chips\n- [ ] Add tag persistence to Firestore\n- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates for tag changes\n\n### Step 4: Search and Filter (Low Complexity)  \n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low\n**Dependencies**: Step 2, Step 3  \n\n- [ ] Complete existing `FileSearch.vue` skeleton component (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Enhance existing `useFileSearch.js` composable (currently 44 lines with basic logic)\n- [ ] Implement real-time filtering logic in store\n- [ ] Add filter state management and persistence\n\n### Step 5: Navigation and Routing (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 2\n\n- [ ] Add \"Organizer\" route to Vue Router configuration\n- [ ] Update navigation sidebar with Organizer link  \n- [ ] Implement route guards for authentication\n- [ ] Add proper page titles and meta information\n\n### Step 6: Integration with Existing System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: High  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 5  \n**Internet Research Summary**: VueFire (official Vue.js Firebase bindings) provides the recommended 2024 approach for Firebase Storage integration with Vue 3. The `useStorageFile()`, `useStorageFileUrl()`, and `useStorageFileMetadata()` composables offer reactive bindings that automatically sync metadata changes. The pattern involves importing composables from VueFire and using reactive references for file operations, which aligns with our existing Firebase setup.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Integration changes can be isolated behind feature flags. Existing upload functionality remains unchanged. If metadata sync fails, system falls back to upload-only mode. Database queries can be reverted to original upload system patterns.\n\n- [ ] Connect to existing Firebase storage system using VueFire patterns\n- [ ] Leverage existing file upload metadata without breaking current functionality\n- [ ] Ensure team-based data isolation maintains existing security model\n- [ ] Test integration with existing authentication system\n\n### Step 7: Testing and Polish (Medium Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: All previous steps  \n\n- [ ] Write unit tests for new components  \n- [ ] Add E2E tests for organizer workflow\n- [ ] Test with large file collections\n- [ ] Performance optimization and loading states\n\n## File Structure\n\n### Files to Enhance (Already Exist as Skeletons)\n```\nsrc/features/organizer/\n├── components/\n│   ├── FileListItem.vue (16 lines → enhance)\n│   ├── FileSearch.vue (16 lines → enhance)  \n│   ├── FileGrid.vue (skeleton → enhance for list view)\n│   └── FileDetails.vue (skeleton → enhance for tag display)\n├── composables/\n│   ├── useFileSearch.js (44 lines → enhance)\n│   └── useFileViewer.js (skeleton → enhance)\n└── views/\n    └── FileViewer.vue (skeleton → repurpose as main Organizer view)\n```\n\n### New Files to Create\n```\nsrc/features/organizer/\n├── components/\n│   └── TagInput.vue (new)\n├── stores/\n│   └── organizer.js (new)\n├── services/\n│   └── organizerService.js (new)\n└── composables/\n    └── useOrganizer.js (new)\n```\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Layout Structure\n- Header with search/filter bar\n- Main content area with file list table\n- Each row shows: filename, file type icon, upload date, tags, actions\n- Tag display as small chips/badges\n- Inline tag editing capability\n\n### Vuetify Components\n- `v-data-table` or `v-list` for file listing\n- `v-chip` for tag display\n- `v-text-field` for search and tag input\n- `v-icon` for file type indicators\n- `v-card` for overall layout container\n\n## Data Flow\n\n1. **File Loading**: Organizer store fetches file metadata from Firestore on mount\n2. **Tag Assignment**: User clicks tag input → opens inline editor → saves to Firestore → updates local state\n3. **Filtering**: User types in search → store computes filtered results → UI updates reactively\n4. **Tag Management**: Add/remove tags → optimistic UI update → Firestore write → error handling\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Store actions and getters\n- Component prop handling and events\n- Tag input validation and formatting\n- Filter logic correctness\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Firestore data operations\n- Authentication integration\n- Route navigation and guards\n- Cross-component data flow\n\n### E2E Tests\n- Complete organizer workflow\n- Tag assignment and search\n- Integration with existing upload system\n- Performance with multiple files\n\n## Single Source of Truth Compliance\n\n### Data Architecture\n- **Primary Source**: Existing upload system hash-based file identification remains authoritative\n- **Metadata Extension**: Tags stored as additional field in existing file documents, not separate collection\n- **Firestore Integration**: Leverages existing file metadata structure to avoid duplication\n- **No Data Duplication**: Tag data extends existing documents rather than creating parallel storage\n\n### Reference Integration\n- File metadata continues using existing Firebase Storage references\n- Tag data stored in same Firestore documents as existing upload metadata\n- Upload system remains unchanged and authoritative for file operations\n- Organizer reads from single source rather than creating separate data stores\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Initial Implementation (v1.0 Scope Only)\n- Simple approach suitable for moderate file collections (100-1000 files)\n- Client-side filtering for responsive UI\n- Basic loading states during data fetch\n- **No premature optimization** - defer performance enhancements to later versions\n\n### Explicitly Deferred to Future Versions\n- Virtual scrolling for large collections (planned for v1.9)\n- Server-side filtering for very large datasets  \n- Lazy loading of file metadata\n- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data\n\n## Security Requirements\n\n### Firestore Rules\n```javascript\n// Ensure users can only access their own team's files\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /fileMetadata/{fileId} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth != null \n        && resource.data.teamId == request.auth.uid;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Data Validation\n- Sanitize tag input to prevent XSS\n- Validate file access permissions\n- Ensure team isolation in all operations\n\n## Migration Strategy\n\n### Existing File Indexing\n```javascript\n// On first Organizer access:\n// 1. Check if user has un-indexed files (files without taggedBy field)\n// 2. Batch create/update metadata documents with empty tags array\n// 3. Show one-time \"Indexing files...\" progress modal\n// 4.

Files exist only as an unstructured list from the upload system, making document discovery time-consuming and inefficient, particularly for legal professionals who need to quickly locate specific documents among hundreds or thousands of uploaded files.\n\n### Solution Overview\nImplement a basic file listing interface with manual tag assignment capability, providing users with fundamental document organization through text-based tags and simple search functionality.\n\n## Core Goal\n\nCreate a simple file list view with manual tag assignment capability, providing users with basic document organization through text-based tags.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Two-Database Design\n\n1. **Storage 1: Uploads** (Existing) - Raw file storage in Firebase Storage\n   - Contains actual file bytes stored by hash\n   - Maintains upload metadata for deduplication\n   - Single source of truth for file content\n\n2. **Database 2: Evidence** (New) - Organizer's core database\n   - References files in Storage 1 via fileHash\n   - Maintains all organizational metadata (tags, categories)\n   - Supports future processing workflow states\n   - Enables multiple evidence entries pointing to same file\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n- Evidence database is separate from upload metadata\n- One uploaded file can have multiple evidence entries (different matters, different tags)\n- Evidence entries reference storage files, never duplicate them\n- Processing status fields included but unused in v1.0 (future-proofing)\n\n## Features to Implement\n\n### 1. Basic File List View\n- Display all uploaded files with metadata (filename, extension, upload date)\n- Integration with existing Firebase storage system\n- Simple table/list interface using Vuetify components\n\n### 2. Manual Tag Assignment\n- Tag input interface for each file (text-based input)\n- Tags stored as array of strings in Firestore\n- Ability to add/remove tags per file\n\n### 3. Basic Search/Filter\n- Text-based filtering by tag names\n- Simple search interface at top of file list\n- Real-time filtering as user types\n\n### 4. Navigation Integration\n- New \"Organizer\" route and navigation item\n- Proper Vue Router integration\n- Route guards for authenticated access\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Data Model\n```javascript\n// NEW: Evidence Database Structure (Database 2: Evidence)\n// Collection: /teams/{teamId}/evidence/{evidenceId}\n{\n  evidenceId: \"auto-generated\", // Firestore auto-ID\n  teamId: \"user-team-id\",\n  \n  // Reference to actual file in Storage 1\n  storageRef: {\n    storage: \"uploads\", // or \"split\", \"merged\" in future versions\n    fileHash: \"abc123...\", // Points to file in Storage 1\n    matterId: \"general\", // Which matter folder in storage\n  },\n  \n  // Evidence metadata\n  displayName: \"Bank Statement March 2024.pdf\", // User-friendly name\n  originalName: \"statement_03_2024.pdf\", // Original upload name\n  fileExtension: \".pdf\",\n  fileSize: 245632,\n  \n  // Processing status (for future Document Processing Workflow)\n  isProcessed: false, // Will be true after v2.0 processing\n  hasAllPages: null, // null = unknown, true/false after processing\n  processingStage: \"uploaded\", // uploaded|splitting|merging|complete\n  \n  // Organization (v1.0 focus)\n  tags: [\"bank-statement\", \"2024\", \"march\"],\n  tagCount: 3,\n  lastTaggedAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  taggedBy: \"manual\", // \"manual\" | \"auto\" in future\n  \n  // Timestamps\n  createdAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  updatedAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"\n}\n```\n\n### Component Structure\n```\nviews/\n  Organizer.vue                 // Main organizer page\ncomponents/features/organizer/\n  FileList.vue                  // File list display component\n  FileListItem.vue              // Individual file row component\n  TagInput.vue                  // Tag input/management component\n  FileFilter.vue                // Search/filter interface\n```\n\n### Store Integration\n```javascript\n// New Pinia store for organizer functionality\nstores/organizer.js\n- fileList: [] // Array of file objects with tags\n- filteredFiles: [] // Computed filtered results\n- filterText: \"\" // Current filter string\n- actions: fetchFiles(), updateFileTags(), filterFiles()\n```\n\n## Existing Codebase Assessment\n\n### Current Organizer Files (Lines of Code)\n- `FileListItem.vue`: 16 lines (skeleton with TODO comments)\n- `FileSearch.vue`: 16 lines (skeleton with TODO comments)  \n- `useFileSearch.js`: 44 lines (partial implementation with basic search logic)\n- Additional skeleton files: `FileGrid.vue`, `FilePreview.vue`, `FileDetails.vue`, `ViewModeToggle.vue`, `FileTypeFilters.vue` (all basic skeletons)\n- Composables: `useFileViewer.js`, `useFilePreview.js`, `useViewerNavigation.js` (skeleton files)\n- Utils: `fileViewerUtils.js`, `previewGenerators.js` (skeleton files)\n\n**Total Existing**: ~15 skeleton files with approximately 200 lines of placeholder code\n\n### Integration Points\n- Existing upload system uses hash-based file identification\n- Firebase Storage already configured and working\n- Authentication system with team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- Vuetify components and styling system established\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Data Layer Setup (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium  \n**Dependencies**: None  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Based on Firebase documentation and 2024 best practices, optimal Firestore collection patterns recommend using lowerCamelCase field names, avoiding sequential document IDs to prevent hotspots, and implementing subcollections for hierarchical data. For file metadata, the recommendation is to denormalize data for query performance while keeping documents under 1MB. The pattern of using hash-based IDs (already implemented in upload system) aligns with best practices for avoiding monotonically increasing IDs that can cause latency issues.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: All data model changes are additive only. New `tags` field can be removed from existing documents without breaking upload functionality. Firestore security rules can be reverted to previous state if needed.\n\n- [ ] Create Firestore collection structure for file metadata\n- [ ] Implement data migration from existing upload system  \n- [ ] Create Pinia store for organizer state management\n- [ ] Add Firestore security rules for organizer data access\n\n### Step 2: Core Components (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1 (data layer)  \n\n- [ ] Enhance existing `Organizer.vue` view component  \n- [ ] Build `FileList.vue` component for displaying files\n- [ ] Complete implementation of existing `FileListItem.vue` skeleton (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Create `TagInput.vue` component for tag management\n\n### Step 3: Tag Management System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium\n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 2  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Vue 3 tag input best practices for 2024 recommend using established UI libraries (PrimeVue, Vuetify, Shadcn/Vue) for production applications. Vuetify's chip component provides built-in accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation. Custom implementations should leverage Composition API with composable patterns for reusability. The recommended pattern includes reactive tag arrays, input validation, and proper event handling for add/remove operations.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Tag functionality can be disabled via feature flag. Firestore writes for tags can be wrapped in try/catch with rollback to previous tag state on failure.\n\n- [ ] Implement tag input interface with add/remove functionality\n- [ ] Create tag display with visual indicators using Vuetify chips\n- [ ] Add tag persistence to Firestore\n- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates for tag changes\n\n### Step 4: Search and Filter (Low Complexity)  \n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low\n**Dependencies**: Step 2, Step 3  \n\n- [ ] Complete existing `FileSearch.vue` skeleton component (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Enhance existing `useFileSearch.js` composable (currently 44 lines with basic logic)\n- [ ] Implement real-time filtering logic in store\n- [ ] Add filter state management and persistence\n\n### Step 5: Navigation and Routing (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 2\n\n- [ ] Add \"Organizer\" route to Vue Router configuration\n- [ ] Update navigation sidebar with Organizer link  \n- [ ] Implement route guards for authentication\n- [ ] Add proper page titles and meta information\n\n### Step 6: Integration with Existing System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: High  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 5  \n**Internet Research Summary**: VueFire (official Vue.js Firebase bindings) provides the recommended 2024 approach for Firebase Storage integration with Vue 3. The `useStorageFile()`, `useStorageFileUrl()`, and `useStorageFileMetadata()` composables offer reactive bindings that automatically sync metadata changes. The pattern involves importing composables from VueFire and using reactive references for file operations, which aligns with our existing Firebase setup.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Integration changes can be isolated behind feature flags. Existing upload functionality remains unchanged. If metadata sync fails, system falls back to upload-only mode. Database queries can be reverted to original upload system patterns.\n\n- [ ] Connect to existing Firebase storage system using VueFire patterns\n- [ ] Leverage existing file upload metadata without breaking current functionality\n- [ ] Ensure team-based data isolation maintains existing security model\n- [ ] Test integration with existing authentication system\n\n### Step 7: Testing and Polish (Medium Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: All previous steps  \n\n- [ ] Write unit tests for new components  \n- [ ] Add E2E tests for organizer workflow\n- [ ] Test with large file collections\n- [ ] Performance optimization and loading states\n\n## File Structure\n\n### Files to Enhance (Already Exist as Skeletons)\n```\nsrc/features/organizer/\n├── components/\n│   ├── FileListItem.vue (16 lines → enhance)\n│   ├── FileSearch.vue (16 lines → enhance)  \n│   ├── FileGrid.vue (skeleton → enhance for list view)\n│   └── FileDetails.vue (skeleton → enhance for tag display)\n├── composables/\n│   ├── useFileSearch.js (44 lines → enhance)\n│   └── useFileViewer.js (skeleton → enhance)\n└── views/\n    └── FileViewer.vue (skeleton → repurpose as main Organizer view)\n```\n\n### New Files to Create\n```\nsrc/features/organizer/\n├── components/\n│   └── TagInput.vue (new)\n├── stores/\n│   └── organizer.js (new)\n├── services/\n│   └── organizerService.js (new)\n└── composables/\n    └── useOrganizer.js (new)\n```\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Layout Structure\n- Header with search/filter bar\n- Main content area with file list table\n- Each row shows: filename, file type icon, upload date, tags, actions\n- Tag display as small chips/badges\n- Inline tag editing capability\n\n### Vuetify Components\n- `v-data-table` or `v-list` for file listing\n- `v-chip` for tag display\n- `v-text-field` for search and tag input\n- `v-icon` for file type indicators\n- `v-card` for overall layout container\n\n## Data Flow\n\n1. **File Loading**: Organizer store fetches file metadata from Firestore on mount\n2. **Tag Assignment**: User clicks tag input → opens inline editor → saves to Firestore → updates local state\n3. **Filtering**: User types in search → store computes filtered results → UI updates reactively\n4. **Tag Management**: Add/remove tags → optimistic UI update → Firestore write → error handling\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Store actions and getters\n- Component prop handling and events\n- Tag input validation and formatting\n- Filter logic correctness\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Firestore data operations\n- Authentication integration\n- Route navigation and guards\n- Cross-component data flow\n\n### E2E Tests\n- Complete organizer workflow\n- Tag assignment and search\n- Integration with existing upload system\n- Performance with multiple files\n\n## Single Source of Truth Compliance\n\n### Data Architecture\n- **Primary Source**: Existing upload system hash-based file identification remains authoritative\n- **Metadata Extension**: Tags stored as additional field in existing file documents, not separate collection\n- **Firestore Integration**: Leverages existing file metadata structure to avoid duplication\n- **No Data Duplication**: Tag data extends existing documents rather than creating parallel storage\n\n### Reference Integration\n- File metadata continues using existing Firebase Storage references\n- Tag data stored in same Firestore documents as existing upload metadata\n- Upload system remains unchanged and authoritative for file operations\n- Organizer reads from single source rather than creating separate data stores\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Initial Implementation (v1.0 Scope Only)\n- Simple approach suitable for moderate file collections (100-1000 files)\n- Client-side filtering for responsive UI\n- Basic loading states during data fetch\n- **No premature optimization** - defer performance enhancements to later versions\n\n### Explicitly Deferred to Future Versions\n- Virtual scrolling for large collections (planned for v1.9)\n- Server-side filtering for very large datasets  \n- Lazy loading of file metadata\n- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data\n\n## Security Requirements\n\n### Firestore Rules\n```javascript\n// Ensure users can only access their own team's files\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /fileMetadata/{fileId} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth != null \n        && resource.data.teamId == request.auth.uid;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Data Validation\n- Sanitize tag input to prevent XSS\n- Validate file access permissions\n- Ensure team isolation in all operations\n\n## Migration Strategy\n\n### Existing File Indexing\n```javascript\n// On first Organizer access:\n// 1.

Ideas\\Organizer-Feature-Reference.md","content":"# Organizer Feature Reference Document\n\n## Overview\n\nThe **Organizer** is an AI-powered document discovery and organization system designed to help users find previously uploaded files through intelligent categorization and flexible viewing interfaces. Rather than traditional folder storage, it uses a tag-based flat storage system with virtual folder presentations optimized for legal document management workflows.\n\n## Core Purpose\n\n**Primary Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.\n\n**Target Use Cases**:\n- Finding bank statements by institution and account details\n- Locating photographs by location and date\n- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)\n- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Storage Strategy\n- **Flat File Storage**: All files stored in single Firebase Storage folder\n- **Tag-Based Organization**: Organization achieved through metadata tags, not physical folders\n- **Virtual Folder Presentation**: Tags dynamically presented as familiar folder structures\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)\n2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly\n3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review\n4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples\n\n## Tag System Design\n\n### Category Structure\n- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\", \"Contract\")\n- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability\n\n### Tag Management\n- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options\n- **Add/Delete Operations**: \n  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents\n  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files\n- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options\n\n### AI Processing Approach\n- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints\n- **Two-Pass Algorithm**:\n  1. **High Confidence Pass**: >90% confidence files categorized immediately\n  2. **Context-Enhanced Pass**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized examples\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Flat View (Default)\n- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags\n- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n\n### Virtual Folder View\n- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n\n### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n\n## Human Review System\n\n### Uncertainty Handling\n- **Review Folder**: \"Human Review Required\" category for uncertain classifications\n- **Confidence Thresholds**: User-adjustable sensitivity settings\n- **Review Interface**: \n  - Top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n  - \"Other\" option for complete misclassification\n  - \"Create New Category\" for expanding taxonomy\n\n### Learning Approach\n- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future medium-confidence decisions\n- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n\n## BATES Numbering System\n\n### Legal Workflow Integration\n- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n\n### Numbering Rules\n- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n\n### Deduplication Integration\n- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n\n## Technical Implementation Approach\n\n### AI Integration\n- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n\n### Data Storage\n- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n- **Metadata Storage**: Firestore documents track tags, categories, processing history, BATES assignments\n- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n\n## User Stories\n\n### Document Discovery Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to find bank statements by institution and account details**\n- Given I have uploaded hundreds of

Rather than traditional folder storage, it uses a tag-based flat storage system with virtual folder presentations optimized for legal document management workflows.\n\n## Core Purpose\n\n**Primary Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.\n\n**Target Use Cases**:\n- Finding bank statements by institution and account details\n- Locating photographs by location and date\n- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)\n- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Storage Strategy\n- **Flat File Storage**: All files stored in single Firebase Storage folder\n- **Tag-Based Organization**: Organization achieved through metadata tags, not physical folders\n- **Virtual Folder Presentation**: Tags dynamically presented as familiar folder structures\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)\n2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly\n3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review\n4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples\n\n## Tag System Design\n\n### Category Structure\n- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\", \"Contract\")\n- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability\n\n### Tag Management\n- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options\n- **Add/Delete Operations**: \n  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents\n  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files\n- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options\n\n### AI Processing Approach\n- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints\n- **Two-Pass Algorithm**:\n  1. **High Confidence Pass**: >90% confidence files categorized immediately\n  2. **Context-Enhanced Pass**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized examples\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Flat View (Default)\n- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags\n- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n\n### Virtual Folder View\n- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n\n### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n\n## Human Review System\n\n### Uncertainty Handling\n- **Review Folder**: \"Human Review Required\" category for uncertain classifications\n- **Confidence Thresholds**: User-adjustable sensitivity settings\n- **Review Interface**: \n  - Top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n  - \"Other\" option for complete misclassification\n  - \"Create New Category\" for expanding taxonomy\n\n### Learning Approach\n- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future medium-confidence decisions\n- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n\n## BATES Numbering System\n\n### Legal Workflow Integration\n- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n\n### Numbering Rules\n- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n\n### Deduplication Integration\n- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n\n## Technical Implementation Approach\n\n### AI Integration\n- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n\n### Data Storage\n- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n- **Metadata Storage**: Firestore documents track tags, categories, processing history, BATES assignments\n- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n\n## User Stories\n\n### Document Discovery Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to find bank statements by institution and account details**\n- Given I have uploaded hundreds of financial documents\n- When I need to find Royal Bank of Canada statements for account ending in 334\n- Then I can use tags to filter by \"Institution: RBC\" and \"Account: ...334\"\n- So that I can

a user, I want to create custom document categories**\n- Given I have unique document types specific to my practice\n- When I create a new \"Document Type\" category\n- Then I can define custom tags like \"Affidavit\", \"Motion\", \"Brief\"\n- So that my organization system matches my specific workflow needs\n\n**As a user, I want to add new tag options to existing categories**\n- Given I encounter a new type of document not in my current system\n- When I add a \"Receipt\" tag to my \"Document Type\" category\n- Then the system asks if I want to reprocess existing documents\n- So that previously uploaded receipts can be properly categorized\n\n**As a user, I want to merge duplicate category options**\n- Given I created both \"Invoice\" and \"Bill\" tags but realize they're the same\n- When I delete the \"Bill\" tag and choose to reprocess affected documents\n- Then all documents previously tagged as \"Bill\" are reconsidered for \"Invoice\"\n- So that I can consolidate my categorization scheme without losing data\n\n### AI Processing Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to process documents in batches by category type**\n- Given I have uploaded a folder of mixed financial documents\n- When I select the folder and choose \"Document Type\" processing\n- Then the AI categorizes documents as statements, invoices, receipts, etc.\n- So that I can organize large batches efficiently without manual sorting\n\n**As a user, I want to review uncertain AI classifications**\n- Given the AI is less than 90% confident about some document categorizations\n- When I access the \"Human Review Required\" folder\n- Then I see the top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n- So that I can quickly correct misclassifications and improve system accuracy\n\n**As a user, I want the system to learn from my corrections**\n- Given I have manually classified several uncertain documents\n- When the AI processes similar documents with medium confidence\n- Then it uses my previous classifications as context examples\n- So that the system becomes more accurate for my specific document types\n\n### Interface Navigation Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to start with a comprehensive flat view**\n- Given I have many documents with various tags\n- When I first access the organizer\n- Then I see all files with color-coded tags by category\n- So that I can understand my entire document collection at a glance\n\n**As a user, I want to create folder views by clicking on tags**\n- Given I see documents with various \"Document Type\" tags in flat view\n- When I right-click on a \"Statement\" tag and select \"Show in Folders\"\n- Then my view reorganizes into folders by document type\n- So that I can browse documents in a familiar folder structure\n\n**As a user, I want to drill down through multiple folder levels**\n- Given I have organized by \"Document Type\" and want to sub-organize by date\n- When I right-click on a \"2023\" tag and select \"Show in Folders\"\n- Then I get a hierarchy like \"Statement > 2023 > March\"\n- So that I can narrow down to very specific document sets\n\n**As a user, I want to instantly reorganize my folder hierarchy**\n- Given I have documents organized by Type > Date\n- When I decide I want them organized by Date > Type instead\n- Then the reorganization happens instantly without processing delays\n- So that I can experiment with different organizational schemes efficiently\n\n### BATES Numbering Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to print documents with BATES stamps for disclosure**\n- Given I need to provide document disclosure for trial\n- When I print any document from the organizer\n- Then it includes a BATES number like \"Roberts-0001\" \n- So that I can track disclosed documents and prevent disclosure confusion\n\n**As a legal professional, I want consistent BATES numbering per matter**\n- Given I'm working on multiple legal matters\n- When I set different prefixes for each case (e.g., \"Smith-\", \"Jones-\")\n- Then each case maintains its own sequential numbering\n- So that documents are properly organized by matter\n\n**As a lawyer, I want permanent BATES number assignment**\n- Given I've printed a document with BATES number \"Roberts-0001\"\n- When I print the same document again later\n- Then it always prints with the same BATES number\n- So that I maintain consistency in legal proceedings\n\n**As a user, I want protection against BATES numbering mistakes**\n- Given I need to restart my BATES numbering due to an error\n- When I create a new prefix for the same matter\n- Then the old prefix is permanently retired and cannot be reused\n- So that there's no confusion about which numbering sequence is current\n\n### Human Review Interface Stories\n\n**As a user, I want simple review options for uncertain documents**\n- Given the AI presents a document with uncertain classification\n- When I see the 3 AI suggestions plus \"Other\" and \"Create New Category\" buttons\n- Then I can quickly select the correct option or create a new one\n- So that document review is fast and doesn't interrupt my workflow\n\n**As a user, I want to create new categories during review**\n- Given I encounter a document type not in my current system\n- When I click \"Create New Category\" during human review\n- Then the system asks if I want to reprocess other documents for this new category\n- So that I can expand my taxonomy as I discover new document types\n\n### Legal Workflow Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to prevent raw document downloads**\n- Given clients or opposing parties might create confusion with untracked copies\n- When I access any document in the organizer\n- Then I can only print BATES-stamped versions, not download raw files\n- So that all document copies in circulation are properly tracked and identified\n\n**As a legal professional, I want to track document processing history**\n- Given I need to verify whether documents have been properly processed\n- When I review any document's metadata\n- Then I can see whether it was classified by AI or human review\n- So that I can ensure quality control in my document management process\n\n## User Experience Flow\n\n### Initial Setup\n1.
