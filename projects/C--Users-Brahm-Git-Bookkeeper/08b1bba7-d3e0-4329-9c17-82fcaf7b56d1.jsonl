What is the primary goal of the organizer feature - is it to categorize uploaded files, create folder structures, or something else?\n\n2. Will the organizer work on files that have already been uploaded through your upload feature, or will it be integrated into the upload process itself?\n\n3. Are you envisioning automatic organization (AI/rule-based) or manual organization by the user?\n\n**User Workflow:**\n4. When would a user typically use the organizer - immediately after upload, periodically in batches, or on-demand?\n\n5. Should users be able to create custom organizational schemes/templates, or will you provide predefined categories?\n\n6. Do you want users to be able to organize files into hierarchical folder structures, flat categories with tags, or both?\n\n**File Handling:**\n7. What types of files will the organizer primarily handle - documents (PDF, Word), images, spreadsheets, or all file types?\n\n8. Should the organizer be able to read file contents to suggest organization (OCR, metadata extraction), or rely on filenames and user input?\n\n9. How should the organizer handle duplicate files that were already deduplicated in your upload system?\n\n**Organization Methods:**\n10. What criteria should drive the organization - date ranges, file types, project names, client names, or custom categories?\n\n11. Should the organizer support multiple organizational views of the same files (e.g., by date AND by category)?\n\n12. Do you want batch operations where users can select multiple files and organize them at once?\n\n**Data Management:**\n13. Will organized files maintain their original upload metadata, or will organization create new metadata layers?\n\n14. Should users be able to rename files during organization, or keep original names?\n\n15. How should the organizer handle file versioning if users upload updated versions of organized files?\n\n**Integration & UI:**\n16. Should the organizer have its own dedicated view/page, or be integrated into existing file management interfaces?\n\n17. Do you want drag-and-drop functionality for moving files between organizational categories?\n\n18. Should there be search and filter capabilities within the organized structure?\n\n**Team/Solo Context:**\n19. Given your solo team architecture, will organization schemes be per-user, or do you anticipate shared organizational templates in the future?\n\n20. Should there be export/import functionality for organizational structures (backup, migration, sharing)?\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n21. Are there any specific business workflows (accounting, client management, project tracking) that should influence the organization structure?\n\n22. Do you want the organizer to integrate with any external systems or just work within your Firebase ecosystem?\n\nPlease start with whichever questions resonate most with your vision, and I'll follow up with more targeted questions based on your responses!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":247,"cache_read_input_tokens":22572,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":247,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":628,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSbcimXmKXXuqcKuZfypv","type":"assistant","uuid":"612fff61-fbc9-4da4-8099-7c3c6881c10e","timestamp":"2025-08-29T07:36:22.404Z"}

And so they'll be categories and tags and basically. each the user could set up a category and then they would have to Define what the available options are in that category. So for example and my previous example I talked about. type as a category and then they usually would have to Define what the different types are and they could be things like in place statement letter email photo. contract certificate etc, etc. So the user could add additional types to a category and you just can also create new categories. and then the way this fits in to folders cuz you had asked about folders. I'm the document storage system are the way that I'm planning on having file stored is a flat structure where all files are in a single folder. And the organization system under the hood the organization system is 100% based on tax. tags with a G so the system the actual Firebase storage system has everything stored in a single folder. upper matter And it's a flat structure. however, with the tags, you know computers I think tags are superior in a lot of ways but for kind of skewomorphic reasons humans Because they're used to working with paper. Most humans still kind of prefer the idea of working with folders. And so we want to have an interface that kind of presents the tags in a folder structure. So, how does that work? So For example, if you are doing a folder structure then each level of depth of that folder structure corresponds to a category. So for example, if we have a category called type and a category called date. You could the user would be able to say. I have their start with their initial. Flat folder structure and be asked you know, how how would you like this these documents organized? and They might would you like them organized first by date or first by type suppose? For example, you just type so then looking at the tags in the type category, we would present the user with what looks like a folder structure so that all of the files are presented, you know, you have a bunch of folders. and each folder has files of that particular type in it And I should point out that this is assuming that our categories. used tags that are mutually exclusive that's kind of key for this folder structure presentation. And so the user says yes, I want them organized by type the interface presents a list of folders with a folder representing each type. Then next how do they want subfolders organized? Perhaps they say by date. next we have subfolders. So for each type we have subfolders for for date and Basketball by date by year. By month, let's see my ear and then by month. and so basically the interface Will have categories of tags, and these are mutually exclusive tags. So that only one tag for category can apply. And that is essential in order for tags to be. Presented to users as folders and one of the big advantages I see with this. Interface is one of the big advantages with tags. Is that you don't have the problem of reorganizing tags like with paper documents you have to put things in folders, but then if you ever decide you want to reorganize your folder structure.

I believe in the k i s s principle. and stick to that we want to keep this as simple as possible, but no simpler than necessary. So with that in mind. There is a limited amount of not exactly. learning but providing improved context for decisions So that would what would happen? is that When you know when these categories are first set up. and the AI is classifying them as different types the algorithm that it would use. First go through and sort out all of the documents that you know, if it's off the most obvious ones the low hanging fruit the clearest cases. I'm sort those out. first and then the next step of the algorithm would be going back to any you know, I'm not sure what the threshold will be. But let's suppose it's for anything of where the AI was less than 90% certain. If it's more than 90% confident, it gets filed immediately if it's less than 90% that one gets passed over until later than after we have. I'm done all the high confidence values. We then go back to the medium confidence ones and we identify okay, if it's no confidence, you know what what options can we narrow it down to? And with to get 90% you know 95% or whatever confidence. It is 95% confidence that it is down to one of these two. two or three folders or two or three types and and then so then for that medium one we within enhance the search by taking this these medium confidence. documents And then using the files that have already been. categorized into those types use them as contacts to help see if that can improve. the confidence of the decision by the AI and hopefully sometimes by using the ones that have already been filed as an example. That can then improve. our confidence levels We would also, you know, there would be. a little bit of tracking in that when When tags are applied we want her tags to keep track of how they were applied because of course needs to be with any human review system. The AI can assign a tag. But occasionally the user will override that or a human reviewer will change that. And so we want to keep track of that. Who made the tag or who categorized the tag? Was it a human or was it an AI and if it is a human? then when we're with that stage of medium confidence documents. Where we are now looking for context to improve our confidence. Or for the AI to improve its confidence. It would prioritize or give more weight. to documents that have been classified by humans so strictly speaking.

Well, I mean I actually should. Before we get there. You may recall before. In the documents. There's a document called document processing workflow.md. and that basically is a workflow that kind of addresses this issue by preprocessing documents before they go to AI for semantic review our type categorization and in this pre-processing stage we're looking to make sure we don't have massive bundles of documents that are actually different documents combined together into a single PDF. By splitting those documents up. into separate individual documents for looking to try and find if they're straight Pages matching them together. I'm so in a long time. We've got this plan for how I would kind of pre-process the documents to hopefully reduce the number of very large documents. now with that said there are occasionally some documents that are very large. Could be and that can be many hundreds of pages. Hopefully that won't happen too often because I think most of the time. Most of the most documents are not hundreds of pages. and when that does happen I had been thinking to possibly Building A system that would. kind of do a look at the big photo kind of use a limited context window that looks only at a single document. and create a bit of a summary of that document. And then use that summary for comparison to other documents and pronounces. But again as I think about it, I think that large language models are just going to get better and better and this is the kind of problem that large language models like Gemini and others. Are going to solve before I do. so yeah, I think. I would not have any stock file size limits. We just use the AI processing. and when files get rid particularly large I I think that you know, that could be a back to the probably I presume we'll probably cause the AI to have potentially less confidence in its categorization decisions when it is dealing with the very large document.

So. for example, if this it bank statement invoices contracts are all falling under the category of a hard copy type or document type supposed to digital document type such as PDF or jpeg. but the document type category would have a color code and all of the tags under the category would have that same color code. And when those tags are displayed in the kind of flat flat View. The user could click on one of those tags, perhaps right click. and have an option, you know show this tag is in show this tag and folders. And so for example, they might see in flat View and see the list big file list and they'll see in that flat view a tag that says statement. So they right click on that and they get an option. see document type category such a statement in folder View and then when they click yes. Now all of their files are now. A separated into folders such as invoices statements contracts Etc. They're now in folders. So now when you open up those folders. you will see the files in the listed with the name. type of digital type of file like file extension It's called file extension. So you'll have the file name the file extension and the date of the file followed by tags. But since you are now already. Looking in a statement some folder. Then we don't need. the statement tag anymore or the invoice tag because you've already filtered. By folders, and so we would see. Maybe we'd see Tags by year. We'd see 2024-2023 2022 different tags for year and since year Is a mutually exclusive category? Then you would see all of those tanks would be the same color and I'll be kind of a blue background. with the year and again, then the user could click on that tag and see if there's a text. That's 22. They right click on it. See the menu. option pop up and ask what they like to sort this tank by folder and I think like yes. now they have a sub folder structure with two categories the first being document type and the second being year"},"uuid":"8ded835b-9d38-435e-9ea8-f3b4af97548a","timestamp":"2025-08-29T08:36:16.975Z"}

That said, users expectations about being able to download documents is probably so strong, that we need some kind of download option.  What about a print to PDF button instead of a download button?

Is we're having to control all of these documents and get them ready for trial. And a huge struggle is when you're having to make sure you provided full disclosure of all documents that becomes very difficult to do. When people are constantly creating new documents and it's just so easy to create new documents when working with digital documents. So You know the idea with a Bates number. Is that by adding a base number to the document so that every time someone prints? a copy of a document from Here they don't just get to download it. They print it and it has a Bates number on it. that makes it so much easier in the future because then I don't in 2 years have someone come and show this document and I'm like, oh have we listed this document? Is it already in our software? Have we missed a document? Well, it might just be that this is a duplicate document that they printed from our website. or printed from our app But it's not going to be detected. It's not going to be detected by Rd duplication. Now we have to rediduplicate things. It's a huge pain in the butt. but if every document that is not downloaded but print it from our website has a baits number added to it. That is so much easier because then two years later someone brings that document is going to Bates number on it. I know that it's just a copy of our own documents and has already been processed. I don't need to put it through the whole system again. That's why. I am considering. Not having any kind of download option.

Ideas\\Organizer-Feature-Reference.md","content":"# Organizer Feature Reference Document\n\n## Overview\n\nThe **Organizer** is an AI-powered document discovery and organization system designed to help users find previously uploaded files through intelligent categorization and flexible viewing interfaces. Rather than traditional folder storage, it uses a tag-based flat storage system with virtual folder presentations optimized for legal document management workflows.\n\n## Core Purpose\n\n**Primary Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.\n\n**Target Use Cases**:\n- Finding bank statements by institution and account details\n- Locating photographs by location and date\n- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)\n- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Storage Strategy\n- **Flat File Storage**: All files stored in single Firebase Storage folder\n- **Tag-Based Organization**: Organization achieved through metadata tags, not physical folders\n- **Virtual Folder Presentation**: Tags dynamically presented as familiar folder structures\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)\n2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly\n3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review\n4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples\n\n## Tag System Design\n\n### Category Structure\n- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\", \"Contract\")\n- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability\n\n### Tag Management\n- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options\n- **Add/Delete Operations**: \n  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents\n  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files\n- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options\n\n### AI Processing Approach\n- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints\n- **Two-Pass Algorithm**:\n  1. **High Confidence Pass**: >90% confidence files categorized immediately\n  2. **Context-Enhanced Pass**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized examples\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Flat View (Default)\n- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags\n- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n\n### Virtual Folder View\n- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n\n### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n\n## Human Review System\n\n### Uncertainty Handling\n- **Review Folder**: \"Human Review Required\" category for uncertain classifications\n- **Confidence Thresholds**: User-adjustable sensitivity settings\n- **Review Interface**: \n  - Top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n  - \"Other\" option for complete misclassification\n  - \"Create New Category\" for expanding taxonomy\n\n### Learning Approach\n- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future medium-confidence decisions\n- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n\n## BATES Numbering System\n\n### Legal Workflow Integration\n- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n\n### Numbering Rules\n- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n\n### Deduplication Integration\n- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n\n## Technical Implementation Approach\n\n### AI Integration\n- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n\n### Data Storage\n- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n- **Metadata Storage**: Firestore documents track tags, categories, processing history, BATES assignments\n- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n\n## User Experience Flow\n\n### Initial Setup\n1. User uploads documents through existing upload feature\n2. Documents appear in flat view with basic metadata\n3. User creates categories and defines tag options\n4. User selects document batches for AI processing\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. User selects folder/batch and processing category\n2. AI processes documents with confidence-based routing\n3. High confidence: Auto-categorized\n4. Medium confidence: Context-enhanced processing using previous examples\n5. Low confidence: Routed to human review folder\n6.

old prefixes never reused\n\n### Deduplication Integration\n- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n\n## Technical Implementation Approach\n\n### AI Integration\n- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n\n### Data Storage\n- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n- **Metadata Storage**: Firestore documents track tags, categories, processing history, BATES assignments\n- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n\n## User Experience Flow\n\n### Initial Setup\n1. User uploads documents through existing upload feature\n2. Documents appear in flat view with basic metadata\n3. User creates categories and defines tag options\n4. User selects document batches for AI processing\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. User selects folder/batch and processing category\n2. AI processes documents with confidence-based routing\n3. High confidence: Auto-categorized\n4. Medium confidence: Context-enhanced processing using previous examples\n5. Low confidence: Routed to human review folder\n6. User reviews uncertain classifications via simple 5-button interface\n\n### Organization and Discovery\n1. User starts in flat view seeing all tags\n2. Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" to create hierarchy\n3. Navigate through virtual folder structure\n4. Find target document and view/print with BATES numbering\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### User Efficiency\n- Time to locate specific documents\n- Reduction in manual file organization effort\n- Accuracy of AI categorization after context enhancement\n\n### Legal Workflow Support\n- Document disclosure completeness\n- BATES numbering consistency\n- Prevention of duplicate processing confusion\n\n### System Performance\n- AI processing accuracy by confidence threshold\n- User override rates in human review\n- Virtual folder reorganization response times\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n### Automation Options\n- Optional automatic processing mode when AI reliability improves\n- User-configurable automation rules and triggers\n\n### Advanced Features\n- Cross-document relationship tracking\n- Bulk download with virtual folder structure preservation\n- Integration with external legal case management systems\n\n### Scalability\n- Multi-user team support (extending solo team architecture)\n- Advanced search across tag combinations\n- Audit trails for document access and modifications\n\n## Technical Dependencies\n\n### External Services\n- Google Gemini API for multimodal document processing\n- Firebase Auth/Firestore/Storage for data management\n\n### Existing Codebase Integration\n- Builds on established upload feature and deduplication system\n- Leverages existing Vue 3/Vuetify component architecture\n- Integrates with solo team authentication model\n\n### Development Approach\n- Follow KISS principle throughout implementation\n- Prefer simple solutions over premature optimization\n- Focus on legal workflow requirements and user experience","numLines":190,"startLine":1,"totalLines":190}}}

Rather than traditional folder storage, it uses a tag-based flat storage system with virtual folder presentations optimized for legal document management workflows.\n\n## Core Purpose\n\n**Primary Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.\n\n**Target Use Cases**:\n- Finding bank statements by institution and account details\n- Locating photographs by location and date\n- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)\n- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Storage Strategy\n- **Flat File Storage**: All files stored in single Firebase Storage folder\n- **Tag-Based Organization**: Organization achieved through metadata tags, not physical folders\n- **Virtual Folder Presentation**: Tags dynamically presented as familiar folder structures\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)\n2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly\n3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review\n4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples\n\n## Tag System Design\n\n### Category Structure\n- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\", \"Contract\")\n- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability\n\n### Tag Management\n- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options\n- **Add/Delete Operations**: \n  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents\n  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files\n- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options\n\n### AI Processing Approach\n- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints\n- **Two-Pass Algorithm**:\n  1. **High Confidence Pass**: >90% confidence files categorized immediately\n  2. **Context-Enhanced Pass**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized examples\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Flat View (Default)\n- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags\n- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n\n### Virtual Folder View\n- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n\n### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n\n## Human Review System\n\n### Uncertainty Handling\n- **Review Folder**: \"Human Review Required\" category for uncertain classifications\n- **Confidence Thresholds**: User-adjustable sensitivity settings\n- **Review Interface**: \n  - Top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n  - \"Other\" option for complete misclassification\n  - \"Create New Category\" for expanding taxonomy\n\n### Learning Approach\n- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future medium-confidence decisions\n- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n\n## BATES Numbering System\n\n### Legal Workflow Integration\n- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n\n### Numbering Rules\n- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n\n### Deduplication Integration\n- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n\n## Technical Implementation Approach\n\n### AI Integration\n- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n\n### Data Storage\n- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n- **Metadata Storage**: Firestore documents track tags, categories, processing history, BATES assignments\n- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n\n## User Experience Flow\n\n### Initial Setup\n1. User uploads documents through existing upload feature\n2. Documents appear in flat view with basic metadata\n3. User creates categories and defines tag options\n4. User selects document batches for AI processing\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. User selects folder/batch and processing category\n2. AI processes documents with confidence-based routing\n3.
