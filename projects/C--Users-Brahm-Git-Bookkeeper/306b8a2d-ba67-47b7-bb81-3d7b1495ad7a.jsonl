Duplicate File Handling\n**As a user**, when the system encounters files that already exist in storage, **I want** to identify and log differences in file names, folder path, and meta data for files with identical SHA256 hash values **so that** all metadata information is preserved.\n\n### 8. Interruption Recovery\n**As a user**, if my upload is interrupted during upload, **I want** the system to pickup from where we left off **so that** we don't repeat the same work.\n\n### 9. Thorough and reliable bulk uploading\n**As a user**, if a file upload starts, **I want** the database to track whether the upload completed successfully **so that** we can ensure that all files are uploaded.\n\n### 10. Upload Completion Notification\n**As a user**, when all files have been successfully uploaded, **I want** to receive a clear completion message with a summary of results, **so that** I know the process finished and can see what was accomplished.\n\n### 11. Failed Upload Summary\n**As a user**, after the upload process completes, **I want** to see a summary of any failed uploads with reasons, **so that** I can address issues and retry if needed.\n\n### 12. Batch Upload Cancellation\n**As a user**, **I want** the ability to cancel the entire upload process if needed, **so that** I can stop unwanted uploads without waiting for completion.\n\n### 13. Post-Upload Detailed Review\n**As a user**, after uploading completes, **I want** the ability to review the upload results file by file, **so that** I can see details of the upload results..\n\n### 14.

If you complete a full cycle through the retry queue without a single successful upload, then provide a Failed Upload Summary modal, and stop making any further attempt.

Here's how it works:\n\n## The `beforeunload` Event\nThis is a browser event that fires when the user is about to leave the page, such as:\n- Closing the browser tab/window\n- Navigating to a different page\n- Refreshing the page\n- Closing the entire browser\n\n## How the Solution Works\n\n### 1. **Saving Progress During Upload**\n```javascript\n// As files upload, continuously save progress to localStorage\nconst uploadProgress = {\n  totalFiles: 100,\n  completedFiles: 45,\n  failedFiles: ['file1.jpg', 'file2.pdf'],\n  currentFile: 'file46.docx',\n  uploadBatchId: 'batch_123456',\n  timestamp: Date.now()\n}\nlocalStorage.setItem('uploadProgress', JSON.stringify(uploadProgress))\n```\n\n### 2. **Detecting Interruption**\n```javascript\n// Listen for user trying to leave the page during upload\nwindow.addEventListener('beforeunload', (event) => {\n  if (isUploading) {\n    // Save current state as \"interrupted\"\n    localStorage.setItem('uploadInterrupted', 'true')\n    \n    // Browser shows \"Are you sure you want to leave?\" dialog\n    event.preventDefault()\n    return \"Upload in progress. Are you sure you want to leave?\"\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### 3. **Detecting Resume Opportunity**\n```javascript\n// When user returns to the page later\nwindow.addEventListener('load', () => {\n  const wasInterrupted = localStorage.getItem('uploadInterrupted')\n  const savedProgress = localStorage.getItem('uploadProgress')\n  \n  if (wasInterrupted && savedProgress) {\n    const progress = JSON.parse(savedProgress)\n    \n    // Show resume dialog\n    showResumeDialog({\n      message: `Found interrupted upload from ${new Date(progress.timestamp).toLocaleString()}`,\n      completedFiles: progress.completedFiles,\n      remainingFiles: progress.totalFiles - progress.completedFiles,\n      onResume: () => resumeUpload(progress),\n      onDiscard: () => clearInterruptedUpload()\n    })\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Why This Provides Great UX\n\n1. **Prevents Lost Work** - Users don't lose hours of upload progress\n2. **Handles Real-World Scenarios** - Accounts for accidental tab closures, browser crashes, network interruptions\n3. **User Choice** - Offers to resume rather than forcing it\n4. **Persistent Across Sessions** - Works even if user comes back days later\n5. **Context Awareness** - Shows exactly what was interrupted and when\n\n## Example User Experience\n1. User starts uploading 500 photos\n2. After 200 files upload, they accidentally close the browser tab\n3. Browser warns: \"Upload in progress. Are you sure you want to leave?\"\n4. User closes anyway (or browser crashes)\n5. Later, when they return to the site:\n   - **Dialog appears**: \"Found interrupted upload from 2:30 PM today. 200 files completed, 300 remaining. Resume upload?\"\n   - User clicks \"Resume\" and upload continues from file #201\n\nThis creates a robust, user-friendly upload experience that handles real-world interruptions gracefully."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":31558,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":31558,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":810,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSWupRimr1tfaJU9aAdEE","type":"assistant","uuid":"43bc2844-ea3b-451d-af0c-4414d810e064","timestamp":"2025-08-26T19:57:34.384Z"}

A **page refresh** is actually one of the easiest scenarios for this solution to handle because the `beforeunload` event fires during refresh, and the page immediately reloads.\n\n## How Page Refresh Works with This Solution\n\n### 1. **During Refresh - beforeunload Fires**\n```javascript\nwindow.addEventListener('beforeunload', (event) => {\n  if (isUploading) {\n    // Save state immediately before page unloads\n    const uploadState = {\n      totalFiles: 100,\n      completedFiles: 45,\n      queuePosition: 46,\n      uploadBatchId: 'batch_123456',\n      timestamp: Date.now(),\n      wasRefresh: true  // Can detect refresh vs. close\n    }\n    \n    localStorage.setItem('uploadProgress', JSON.stringify(uploadState))\n    localStorage.setItem('uploadInterrupted', 'true')\n    \n    // Show browser's \"leave page\" warning\n    event.preventDefault()\n    return \"Upload in progress. Refreshing will interrupt the upload.\"\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### 2. **Page Reloads - Immediately Check for Resume**\n```javascript\n// This runs as soon as the refreshed page loads\nwindow.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n  const wasInterrupted = localStorage.getItem('uploadInterrupted')\n  const savedProgress = localStorage.getItem('uploadProgress')\n  \n  if (wasInterrupted && savedProgress) {\n    const progress = JSON.parse(savedProgress)\n    \n    // Very recent timestamp suggests refresh (not days later)\n    const isRecentRefresh = (Date.now() - progress.timestamp) < 5000 // 5 seconds\n    \n    if (isRecentRefresh) {\n      // Auto-show resume dialog since this was just refreshed\n      showResumeDialog({\n        title: \"Upload Interrupted by Page Refresh\",\n        message: `${progress.completedFiles}/${progress.totalFiles} files were uploaded before refresh.`,\n        autoFocus: true,  // Make resume button focused\n        onResume: () => resumeFromFile(progress.queuePosition),\n        onDiscard: () => clearUploadState()\n      })\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## User Experience Flow\n\n### Scenario: User Refreshes During Upload\n\n1. **User uploads 200/500 files**\n2. **User hits F5 or Ctrl+R**\n3. **Browser shows warning**: \"Upload in progress. Refreshing will interrupt the upload.\"\n4. **If user continues with refresh**:\n   - Page reloads in ~1-2 seconds\n   - **Immediate resume dialog**: \"Upload interrupted by page refresh. 200/500 files uploaded. Resume upload?\"\n   - User clicks \"Resume\" → Upload continues from file #201\n\n### Key Advantages for Refresh\n\n1. **Instant Recovery** - No delay between refresh and resume option\n2. **Context Preserved** - All upload state maintained through the refresh\n3. **User Warned** - Browser shows warning before refresh happens\n4. **Seamless Resume** - Can pick up exactly where left off\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n\n```javascript\n// Enhanced state saving for refresh detection\nfunction saveUploadState() {\n  const state = {\n    files: currentFileQueue,\n    completed: completedFiles.map(f => f.id),\n    failed: failedFiles.map(f => f.id),\n    currentIndex: currentUploadIndex,\n    batchId: uploadBatchId,\n    timestamp: Date.now(),\n    userAgent: navigator.userAgent, // Verify same browser\n    sessionId: generateSessionId()\n  }\n  \n  localStorage.setItem('bookkeeper_upload_state', JSON.stringify(state))\n}\n\n// Resume logic after refresh\nfunction resumeUpload(savedState) {\n  // Reconstruct file queue, skipping completed files\n  const remainingFiles = originalFileQueue.filter(file => \n    !savedState.completed.includes(file.id)\n  )\n  \n  // Continue upload from where we left off\n  startUpload(remainingFiles, {\n    resumedFromInterruption: true,\n    previousBatchId: savedState.batchId\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## Edge Cases Handled\n\n- **Multiple rapid refreshes** - Only most recent state is kept\n- **Browser crash vs refresh** - Both handled the same way\n- **Partial file uploads** - Firebase handles incomplete uploads gracefully\n- **Time limits** - Old interrupted uploads (>24hrs) can be auto-discarded\n\nThe refresh scenario is actually ideal because the interruption and resume happen within seconds, making it feel almost seamless to the user."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":823,"cache_read_input_tokens":31558,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":823,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1109,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSWuv9hHWrtn9iDPdpvjB","type":"assistant","uuid":"fcf47934-669b-4601-8b00-1ffb8d83c601","timestamp":"2025-08-26T19:58:57.209Z"}

Start over or go to upload history?\")\n}\n```\n\n### Phase 2: **Robust Version (Complex)**\n- Query Firebase to verify what actually uploaded\n- Handle edge cases and race conditions  \n- Mobile browser compatibility\n- Multiple tab coordination\n- Corruption recovery\n\n## Honest Assessment\n\n- **Basic functionality**: 2-3 hours of development\n- **Production-ready version**: 1-2 weeks with proper testing\n- **Bulletproof version**: Could take a month with all edge cases\n\nThe concept is simple, but the devil is in the details!
