The number of elements that are rendered at first is a very small subset of the entire list and the \"window\" of visible content moves when the user continues to scroll. This improves both the rendering and scrolling performance of the list.(no content)A virtualized list is a technique used to efficiently render and display large lists or collections of items in user interfaces, particularly when dealing with thousands or millions of items. Instead of rendering all the items at once, which can cause performance issues (like slow rendering and high memory usage), only the items currently visible on the screen (or close to it) are rendered.\n\n### Performance Benefits\nWhen rendering a large dataset, React creates DOM nodes for every item in the list. This approach has several drawbacks: High Memory Usage: Every rendered DOM node consumes memory. For large lists, this can lead to significant memory overhead. Poor Rendering Performance: Rendering thousands of items at once takes time, leading to a sluggish UI.\n\n## React Solutions (2024-2025)\n\n### Popular Libraries\nTanstack Virtual is currently (November 2024) the most popular library for virtualized lists. It stands out among other libraries due to its modern architecture, flexibility, and feature set.(no content)react-window is a small, third-party library that makes it easier to create virtualized lists in your application. It provides a number of base APIs that can be used for different types of lists and tables.\n\n### Best Practices for React\nWrap your virtualized list with react-window-infinite-loader if you need to lazy load items as the user scrolls. Use the overscanCount property for your lists and the overscanColumnsCount and overscanRowsCount properties for your grids to prevent a flash of empty content.(no content)Virtualization is a must-have technique for scaling React applications that handle large datasets. By integrating libraries like react-window, you can ensure your app remains performant and provides a smooth user experience. Combine virtualization with lazy loading and prefetching strategies for the best results.\n\n## Vue.js Solutions (2024-2025)\n\n### Official Vue Recommendations\nNo matter how performant a framework is, rendering a list with thousands of items will be slow due to the sheer number of DOM nodes that the browser needs to handle. However, we don't necessarily have to render all these nodes upfront. In most cases, the user's screen size can display only a small subset of our large list. We can greatly improve the performance with list virtualization, the technique of only rendering the items that are currently in or close to the viewport in a large list.\n\n### Vue-Specific Libraries\nvue-virtual-scroller is a Vue.js plugin that applies the virtual scroll technique in order to performantly render a list to the DOM, whether it's a plain HTML ul > li list, a table, or a customized list.\n\n### Vue Performance Best Practices 2024-2025\nVue.js Virtual Scrolling: When working with long lists or tables, use virtual scrolling to render only the visible portion of the list, reducing the DOM's workload and improving performance.(no content)Replace ref with shallowRef when working with arrays with 1000s of items and trigger updates by replacing the entire array. Do: Define large datasets with shallowRef.\n\n## Latest Optimization Techniques\n\n### Lazy Loading Implementation\nIn page transitions, we want to render above-the-fold content as soon as possible and delay rendering of the off-screen content for later. In infinite scrolling, we want to render content just in time when it's about to enter the viewport.(no content)Lazy loading in Vue.js: Use shallowRef and shallowReactive to limit reactivity to top-level properties only, reducing unnecessary overhead from Vue's reactivity system.\n\n### Advanced Techniques\nComponent Memoization: Vue 3's v-memo directive enables you to memoize expensive components, ensuring they aren't recalculated or re-rendered unnecessarily. This is particularly useful for components that rely on static or rarely updated data.\n\n### When to Use Virtual Scrolling\nInfinite Scrolling: For apps requiring endless scrolling, e.g., social media feeds or e-commerce product lists. Grids with High Complexity: Use for layouts with thousands of cells, such as spreadsheets or complex tables. Small Data Sets: For lists with fewer than 100 items, virtualization may add unnecessary complexity.\n\nThe current best practices for 2024-2025 emphasize combining virtual scrolling with lazy loading, using modern libraries like TanStack Virtual for React and vue-virtual-scroller for Vue.js, and implementing shallow reactivity for large datasets to maximize performance."}]},"uuid":"c230ad7e-7a97-4810-b787-cd37f1b8140c","timestamp":"2025-08-23T20:04:13.588Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"virtual scrolling lazy loading large lists DOM performance Vue.js React best practices 2024 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01NBwtc5DP9y7pT3ssToo46v","content":[{"title":"Virtualization in React: Improving Performance for Large Lists | by Dzmitry Ihnatovich | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@ignatovich.dm/virtualization-in-react-improving-performance-for-large-lists-3df0800022ef"},{"title":"Performance | Vue.js","url":"https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/performance.html"},{"title":"<Lazy> rendering in Vue to improve performance | by Martin Malinda | Vue.js Developers | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/js-dojo/lazy-rendering-in-vue-to-improve-performance-dcccd445d5f"},{"title":"How to Maximize Vue.js Performance: 4 Proven Techniques for Faster Web Apps | Monterail blog","url":"https://www.monterail.com/blog/how-to-maximize-vue-js-performance-proven-techniques"},{"title":"Virtualize large lists with react-window | Articles | web.dev","url":"https://web.dev/articles/virtualize-long-lists-react-window"},{"title":"Performant Lists and Tables in Vue.js with vue-virtual-scroller | DigitalOcean","url":"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/vuejs-vue-virtual-scroller"},{"title":"Performance Optimization Techniques for Vue.js Applications - Certificates.dev Blog","url":"https://certificates.dev/blog/performance-optimization-techniques-for-vuejs-applications"},{"title":"Optimizing Large Datasets with Virtualized Lists | by Eva Matova | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@eva.matova6/optimizing-large-datasets-with-virtualized-lists-70920e10da54"},{"title":"GitHub - tangbc/vue-virtual-scroll-list: ⚡A vue component support big amount data list with high render performance and efficient.","url":"https://github.com/tangbc/vue-virtual-scroll-list"},{"title":"Efficient Rendering with useVirtualizedList: A Guide to Virtualized Scrolling in React - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/muhammad4dev/efficient-rendering-with-usevirtualizedlist-a-guide-to-virtualized-scrolling-in-react-3fh7"}]},"Based on your search query about virtual scrolling, lazy loading, large lists, DOM performance, and best practices for Vue.js and React in 2024-2025, here's a comprehensive overview of the current state and best practices:\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Virtual Scrolling\nVirtual scrolling, or \"windowing\", is the concept of only rendering what is visible to the user.

Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n## Vue.js Performance Testing & Optimization for Large Lists\n\n### Memory Profiling Tools for Vue.js\nUse Chrome's Memory tab to monitor memory usage and look for any components that are not being appropriately destroyed.(no content)Vue Performance Devtools can also help track Vue components or objects lingering in memory longer than necessary.\n\n### Large List Performance Issues\nOne of the most common performance issues in all frontend applications is rendering large lists. No matter how performant a framework is, rendering a list with thousands of items will be slow due to the sheer number of DOM nodes that the browser needs to handle.\n\n### Solutions for Large Lists\n\n**Virtual Scrolling:**\nWe can greatly improve the performance with list virtualization, the technique of only rendering the items that are currently in or close to the viewport in a large list.(no content)Vue.js Virtual Scrolling: When working with long lists or tables, use virtual scrolling to render only the visible portion of the list, reducing the DOM's workload and improving performance.\n\n**Virtual Scrolling Implementation:**\nTo solve this issue, you could use the vue-virtual-scroller package.\n\n### Memory Leak Prevention\nUnremoved Event Listeners: If a component attaches event listeners that aren't cleaned up when the component is destroyed, they remain in memory.(no content)The most common scenario for a memory leak is adding a window event listener in the initial load of the component but not removing it after the component is unmounted.\n\n### Performance Monitoring Setup\napp.config.performance enables Vue-specific performance markers in Chrome DevTools' performance timeline.(no content)Vue DevTools Extension also provides a performance profiling feature.\n\n### Optimization Techniques for 2024\n\n**Shallow Reactivity:**\nIn Vue 3, you can reduce unnecessary re-renders by using shallowRef or shallowReactive for data that doesn't require deep reactivity.\n\n**Memoization:**\nComponent Memoization: Vue 3's v-memo directive enables you to memoize expensive components, ensuring they aren't recalculated or re-rendered unnecessarily.\n\n**Performance Testing Best Practices:**\nAlways measure the impact of your optimizations using Vue's devtools and browser performance profiling tools to ensure you're making meaningful improvements.\n\n### Recent Memory Management Insights (2024/2025)\nRecently, we encountered high memory usage in the frontend of our application.

Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n## Vue.js Performance Testing & Optimization for Large Lists\n\n### Memory Profiling Tools for Vue.js\nUse Chrome's Memory tab to monitor memory usage and look for any components that are not being appropriately destroyed.(no content)Vue Performance Devtools can also help track Vue components or objects lingering in memory longer than necessary.\n\n### Large List Performance Issues\nOne of the most common performance issues in all frontend applications is rendering large lists. No matter how performant a framework is, rendering a list with thousands of items will be slow due to the sheer number of DOM nodes that the browser needs to handle.\n\n### Solutions for Large Lists\n\n**Virtual Scrolling:**\nWe can greatly improve the performance with list virtualization, the technique of only rendering the items that are currently in or close to the viewport in a large list.(no content)Vue.js Virtual Scrolling: When working with long lists or tables, use virtual scrolling to render only the visible portion of the list, reducing the DOM's workload and improving performance.\n\n**Virtual Scrolling Implementation:**\nTo solve this issue, you could use the vue-virtual-scroller package.\n\n### Memory Leak Prevention\nUnremoved Event Listeners: If a component attaches event listeners that aren't cleaned up when the component is destroyed, they remain in memory.(no content)The most common scenario for a memory leak is adding a window event listener in the initial load of the component but not removing it after the component is unmounted.\n\n### Performance Monitoring Setup\napp.config.performance enables Vue-specific performance markers in Chrome DevTools' performance timeline.(no content)Vue DevTools Extension also provides a performance profiling feature.\n\n### Optimization Techniques for 2024\n\n**Shallow Reactivity:**\nIn Vue 3, you can reduce unnecessary re-renders by using shallowRef or shallowReactive for data that doesn't require deep reactivity.\n\n**Memoization:**\nComponent Memoization: Vue 3's v-memo directive enables you to memoize expensive components, ensuring they aren't recalculated or re-rendered unnecessarily.\n\n**Performance Testing Best Practices:**\nAlways measure the impact of your optimizations using Vue's devtools and browser performance profiling tools to ensure you're making meaningful improvements.\n\n### Recent Memory Management Insights (2024/2025)\nRecently, we encountered high memory usage in the frontend of our application. There can be many reasons for this, and I'll discuss a few…(no content)Scroll Pagination: Continuous scroll loading creates persistent DOM nodes for previously loaded content, causing memory to grow.

The tools provide multiple ways to monitor JavaScript performance and memory usage:\n\n### Performance Monitor Panel\nThe Performance monitor gives a general idea of your website's runtime performance, and observing how metric values change as you interact with your website can reveal opportunities for improvement. Key features include:\n\n- JavaScript heap size monitoring\n- The total number of DOM nodes, JavaScript event listeners, documents, and frames on the page\n- Layouts and style recalculations per second(no content)A useful feature of the Performance monitor is that it persists throughout page navigation.\n\n### Memory Analysis Features\nEnable the Memory checkbox to view memory metrics from the last recording. DevTools displays a new Memory chart, above the Summary tab. The memory monitoring includes:\n\n- There's also a new chart below the NET chart, called HEAP. The HEAP chart provides the same information as the JS Heap line in the Memory chart.\n- The JavaScript Memory column represents the JS heap, and the live number represents how much memory the reachable objects on your page are using.\n\n## Browser Performance APIs\n\n### Web Performance API\nThe Performance interface provides access to performance-related information for the current page. Key memory-related methods include:\n\n- The measureUserAgentSpecificMemory() method is used to estimate the memory usage of a web application including all its iframes and workers.\n- The non-standard and legacy memory read-only property returns the size of the JavaScript heap which can be helpful to measure and reduce the memory footprint of websites.\n\n## Automated Performance Testing & Extensions\n\nUse the chrome.devtools.performance API to listen to recording status updates in the Performance panel in DevTools. By listening to these events, developers can create extensions that react to the recording status in the Performance panel, providing additional automation during performance profiling.\n\n## Memory Issue Detection Techniques\n\nChrome DevTools can be used to find memory issues that affect page performance, including memory leaks, memory bloat, and frequent garbage collections. Common symptoms include:\n\n- A page's performance gets progressively worse over time, possibly a symptom of a memory leak when a bug causes the page to progressively use more memory over time.\n- A page's performance is delayed or appears to pause frequently, possibly a symptom of frequent garbage collections.\n\nThe documentation shows that Chrome DevTools continues to evolve with regular updates in 2024, providing comprehensive tools for JavaScript performance monitoring, memory analysis, and automated testing capabilities through both built-in panels and extensible APIs."}]},"uuid":"bec4dc3f-d6ae-4f2c-80be-ea2c04c54fda","timestamp":"2025-08-23T20:05:44.013Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"browser performance API JavaScript memory monitoring Chrome DevTools performance testing automated 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_014xnV27Tb2n9mkiyzx5CTsz","content":[{"title":"Analyze runtime performance | Chrome DevTools | Chrome for Developers","url":"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance"},{"title":"Performance monitor panel | Chrome DevTools | Chrome for Developers","url":"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance-monitor"},{"title":"chrome.devtools.performance | API | Chrome for Developers","url":"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/devtools/performance"},{"title":"Performance features reference | Chrome DevTools | Chrome for Developers","url":"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/reference"},{"title":"Performance: measureUserAgentSpecificMemory() method - Web APIs | MDN","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/measureUserAgentSpecificMemory"},{"title":"Performance - Web APIs | MDN","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance"},{"title":"Fix memory problems | Chrome DevTools | Chrome for Developers","url":"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems"},{"title":"Performance: memory property - Web APIs | MDN","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/memory"},{"title":"Chrome DevTools | Chrome for Developers","url":"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/rendering-tools"},{"title":"Comprehensive guide to JavaScript performance analysis using Chrome DevTools","url":"https://blog.jiayihu.net/comprenhensive-guide-chrome-performance/"}]},"Based on your search query, I found comprehensive information about browser performance APIs, JavaScript memory monitoring, Chrome DevTools, and performance testing automation.

This makes the code more modular and readable.\n\n### 2. **Extracting to Composables**\nThe Composition API makes it easy to extract and reuse component logic via composable functions, allowing you to share functionality between different components more efficiently.\n\nKey composable patterns:\n- Composables should wrap certain logic inside and when too complex, they should be extracted into separate composables for easier testing\n- You can nest composables: one composable function can call one or more other composable functions. This enables us to compose complex logic using small, isolated units\n\n### 3. **Practical Component Extraction Process**\nThe process becomes almost mechanical—identify a section in the template, extract the script and logic, set up communication channels, move the styles, and write tests. With each iteration, the once-monolithic component transformed into a well-organized system of smaller, more manageable pieces.\n\n## Best Practices for 2024\n\n### **Gradual Migration Approach**\nIf you are working on an existing project with many components built using the Options API, migrating everything to the Composition API might be more effort than it's worth. In such cases, it might be better to gradually introduce the Composition API in new components or refactor parts of the codebase over time.\n\n### **Component Communication**\nCarefully identify the props each sub-component needs and decide which actions should stay internal and which should be communicated back to the parent component. This balance helped keep each sub-component focused on its responsibilities while still ensuring smooth communication with the parent.\n\n### **Testing Strategy**\nAs I pulled each sub-component out, I immediately wrote component tests and unit tests to verify that it behaved as expected. This \"test-as-you-go\" method gave me confidence that the refactoring wasn't introducing new bugs.\n\n## Refactoring Outcomes\n\nThe benefits of proper component extraction include:\n- The original component was reduced to less than 400 lines, and I created six new sub-components, one composable, and one utility. The total lines of code is only a 100 lines smaller, but the clarity, maintainability, and testability improved dramatically\n- By allowing logic to be split into independent functions, the Composition API makes components easier to maintain and test. This is especially beneficial in large and complex applications\n\nThe Composition API in Vue 3 represents the current best practice for component refactoring, providing better maintainability, testability, and reusability compared to the Options API approach."}]},"uuid":"3c2f35ba-379c-4574-8df1-aefb7e2e3fd8","timestamp":"2025-08-23T20:06:17.499Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Vue.js component extraction refactoring best practices 2024 composition API component splitting patterns","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01VPDhRerfQ1YRDyfnAmrNHq","content":[{"title":"Composition API FAQ | Vue.js","url":"https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq"},{"title":"Good practices and Design Patterns for Vue Composables - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/jacobandrewsky/good-practices-and-design-patterns-for-vue-composables-24lk"},{"title":"Design Patterns and best practices with the Composition API in Vue 3 | by David May | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@davisaac8/design-patterns-and-best-practices-with-the-composition-api-in-vue-3-77ba95cb4d63"},{"title":"The Ultimate Guide to Vue 3 Composition API: Tips and Best Practices - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/delia_code/the-ultimate-guide-to-vue-3-composition-api-tips-and-best-practices-54a6"},{"title":"Composables | Vue.js","url":"https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html"},{"title":"How the Vue Composition API Replaces Vue Mixins | CSS-Tricks","url":"https://css-tricks.com/how-the-vue-composition-api-replaces-vue-mixins/"},{"title":"Taming the Mega-Component: My Vue.js Refactoring Adventure - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/rrd/taming-the-mega-component-my-vuejs-refactoring-adventure-5a3"},{"title":"Refactoring Vue.js code.

The total lines of code is only a 100 lines smaller, but the clarity, maintainability, and testability improved dramatically\n- By allowing logic to be split into independent functions, the Composition API makes components easier to maintain and test. This is especially beneficial in large and complex applications\n\nThe Composition API in Vue 3 represents the current best practice for component refactoring, providing better maintainability, testability, and reusability compared to the Options API approach."],"durationSeconds":26.9075796}}

Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Key Vue.js Component Refactoring Patterns for 2024\n\n### Template Extraction Patterns\n\n**Branching Component Pattern**: Extract complex conditional rendering into separate components. Instead of multiple v-if branches in one component, create dedicated components for each state. The resulting code is easier to read and maintain over time.\n\n**Component Boundaries Pattern**: The first task was to break the component into smaller, logical parts. I started by examining the template to identify distinct functionalities. I quickly found a few key candidates for extraction: a menu, a search form, a list display, and three tables that were nearly identical. These distinct elements would become separate, dedicated components.\n\n### Props Design and Architecture\n\n**Smart vs Dumb Components**: Following the \"Props down, events up\" principle, these components ensure clear, predictable data flow, making them easy to reuse, test, and maintain.\n\n**Template Props vs Slots**: Whenever you have a prop that gets passed directly to the template, that's a good sign you should be using a slot instead. They serve the same purpose, but the slot allows more flexibility.\n\n### List Component Extraction\n\n**Item Component Pattern**: Extracting each item in the list to it's own ListItem component, makes the List component easy to read, and provides more focus when developing and styling each item. Additionally, Large lists in components can lead to cluttered and unwieldy templates. The solution is to abstract the v-for loop logic into a child component. This simplifies the parent and encapsulates the iteration logic in a dedicated list component, keeping things nice and tidy.\n\n### Maintainability Results\n\nA real-world refactoring example demonstrates the impact: The original component was reduced to less than 400 lines, and I created six new sub-components, one composable, and one utility. The total lines of code is only a 100 lines smaller, but the clarity, maintainability, and testability improved dramatically.\n\n### Modern 2024 Approaches\n\n**Composables for Logic Extraction**: Extracting logic into composables, even for single-use cases. Composables simplify components, making them easier to understand and maintain. They also facilitate adding related methods and state, such as undo and redo features. This helps us keep logic separate from UI.\n\n**Template Object Extraction**: To fix this behavior we can extract the object into a computed property. This makes the structure of the object clear. Also, it is not really important to understand the exact structure of the object in the template part.\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\nWhen refactoring large components, The next hurdle was to figure out how these new components would talk to each other. I had to carefully identify the props each sub-component needed and decide which actions should stay internal and which should be communicated back to the parent component. This balance helped keep each sub-component focused on its responsibilities while still ensuring smooth communication with the parent.\n\nThese patterns and techniques form a comprehensive approach to refactoring large Vue.js components while maintaining clean architecture and improving long-term maintainability."}]},"uuid":"d7dbdc2c-f0c2-42a8-9af7-f907f54afd5a","timestamp":"2025-08-23T20:06:51.251Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Vue.js large component refactoring patterns template extraction props design 2024 maintainability","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01U1ZCMCe1sgyuAf6koxjpzb","content":[{"title":"5 Component Design Patterns to Boost Your Vue.js Applications - Vue School Articles","url":"https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/5-component-design-patterns-to-boost-your-vue-js-applications/"},{"title":"Taming the Mega-Component: My Vue.js Refactoring Adventure - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/rrd/taming-the-mega-component-my-vuejs-refactoring-adventure-5a3"},{"title":"12 Design Patterns in Vue | Michael Thiessen","url":"https://michaelnthiessen.com/12-design-patterns-vue/"},{"title":"Vue Component Design: Master Scalable Vue.js Patterns","url":"https://vueschool.io/courses/vue-component-design-2"},{"title":"Learn to refactor Vue.js SFCs in a real-world example","url":"https://www.kevinpeters.net/learn-to-refactor-vue-js-sf-cs-in-a-real-world-example"},{"title":"Style Guide | Vue Patterns","url":"https://learn-vuejs.github.io/vue-patterns/useful-links/"},{"title":"How to Structure a Large Scale Vue.js Application - Vue School Articles","url":"https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/how-to-structure-a-large-scale-vue-js-application/"},{"title":"Refactoring Vue.js code.

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Progressive Loading and Multiple Progress Indicators\n\nThere are basically two types of loading indicators: determinate progress indicators that communicate a sense of duration with a start and end point, and indeterminate progress indicators with uncertain duration, like looping animations or spinners.\n\nFor short wait times (1-3 seconds), designers should use indeterminate indicators like skeleton screens or spinners. For medium wait times (3-10 seconds), determinate progress indicators like progress bars are advisable. For long wait times (10+ seconds), a clear interface showcasing progress with user interaction capabilities is recommended.\n\n## Skeleton Loading States - The Modern Standard\n\nSkeleton screens are indeterminate and are the new norm for full-page loading situations, consisting of immediately showing a wireframe-type loading screen before real content shows up. Research comparing spinners and skeleton screens revealed that skeleton screens are perceived as faster and leave users happier.\n\n## Progressive Loading Implementation\n\nEffective progressive loading shows content as soon as it's ready to keep users informed. Skeleton screens reveal each part of the UI as loading progresses, starting with a skeleton outline and proceeding in the order of skeleton outline, text, then images.\n\nProgressive loading is a technique that loads pages in batches. The simplest view loads first, followed by progressively detailed batches. The primary batch should show basic structure (skeleton states), while following batches include images, content outside viewport, and interactive components.\n\n## 2024 Best Practices\n\nWith skeleton screens, it helps to implement multiple progression phases to keep activating the user's focus. Designing skeleton screens that leverage motion (left to right following natural eye movement) helps decrease perceived duration time. Progressive loading where individual elements become visible as soon as loaded provides clear indication of progress.\n\n## Key Design Considerations\n\nSpinners work best for 2-10 second loads, skeleton screens should be used for under 10 seconds, while progress bars are strongly recommended for anything over 10 seconds as they provide duration estimates.\n\nFor extended wait times, utilize a combination of strategies such as shimmer effects, background tasks, and storytelling/tips to engage users.\n\nThe search results indicate that skeleton screens with progressive loading have become the dominant UX pattern in 2024, offering superior user experience compared to traditional loading spinners by creating the illusion of faster loading and providing clear visual progress indication."}]},"uuid":"6e3bb7ba-7388-4b8c-a00f-0d31f48896bb","timestamp":"2025-08-23T20:07:22.223Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"progressive loading UI patterns multiple progress indicators UX design 2024 skeleton loading states","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01MN1GTHvSMu5zXcqcA6Faht","content":[{"title":"UX Design Patterns for Loading - Pencil & Paper","url":"https://www.pencilandpaper.io/articles/ux-pattern-analysis-loading-feedback"},{"title":"Progress Indicators Make a Slow System Less Insufferable - NN/G","url":"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/"},{"title":"Your Loading Spinner Is a UX Killer!

They have a start point and an end point. They give users more information on how much time they can expect to wait.(no content)Indeterminate progress indicators have an uncertain duration. A common example is a looping animation, or a spinner. They are less informative, but are sometimes inevitable.\n\n### Timing Guidelines for Multiple States\nIf the load time is less than three seconds, you can simply display quick animations or microcopy like \"Loading, please wait.\" However, anything above three seconds will make users anxious and leave them wondering how long they have to wait—this is when to display a progress bar.(no content)For anything that takes less than 1 second to load, it is distracting to use a looped animation, because users cannot keep up with what happened and might feel anxious about whatever flashed on the screen. After 2 seconds, we enter the realm of more informative progress indicators.\n\n## Coordination Patterns for Multiple Loading States\n\n### Segmented Progress Indicators\nA segmented progress indicator is a visual representation of a user's progress through a series of steps leading to the completion of a particular process. It is best suited for clear and distinct stages or steps that the system is completing.\n\n### Progress Bar Variations\nSeveral types of progress bars are effective for coordinating multiple states:\n\n1. **Percentage Progress Bars**: A percentage progress bar displays the exact proportion of a task that has been completed, giving users three key pieces of information: Progress so far: The percentage value clearly indicates how much of the task has been accomplished.\n\n2. **Time Estimate Progress Bars**: A time estimate progress bar counts down, providing an estimated remaining time in minutes or hours. Typically, the estimate is calculated based on the current progress and the average completion rate.\n\n3. **Steps-Left Progress Bars**: This type of progress bar focuses on the remaining steps or stages in a multi-step process. It's ideal for complex tasks with a clear sequence, such as onboarding flows and multi-part surveys. To clearly illustrate progress, the indicator divides the process into distinct segments, each representing a step.\n\n## 2024 Best Practices\n\n### Managing User Expectations\nLoading indicators are all about balancing perceived time and perceived value. In other words, the loading time should equate to the perceived value of the task at hand.(no content)Loading states are also a good opportunity to set expectations of users in your product. They can be used as a communication device to reduce uncertainty for the user by explaining what's happening or preparing them for what's coming up next.\n\n### Design Considerations\nClarity is key when it comes to progress bars. Users need to be able to quickly and easily understand the status of a task. This can be achieved through the use of text, percentages, or visual cues. For example, a progress bar with clear indicators can provide a visual representation of the task's progress, while a percentage completed can give users a more specific measurement.\n\n### Error Handling in Concurrent States\nIn case of an error, the indicator turns into a full-width red bar. In case of success, the indicator turns into a full-width green bar.\n\nThe search reveals that modern UX design in 2024 emphasizes clear communication of system status, proper timing for different types of indicators, and thoughtful coordination between multiple loading states to reduce user anxiety and improve overall experience."}]},"uuid":"8eacc88b-ced5-4252-aaaf-569e1f3919b5","timestamp":"2025-08-23T20:07:55.306Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"concurrent progress indicators UI design multiple loading states coordination UX patterns 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_018wBxiiFxDWZySbfGkzR9UA","content":[{"title":"UX Design Patterns for Loading - Pencil & Paper","url":"https://www.pencilandpaper.io/articles/ux-pattern-analysis-loading-feedback"},{"title":"How to Design Better Progress Trackers and Control User Expectations","url":"https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/design-progress-trackers/"},{"title":"Using a Progress Bar (UI) in SaaS: 5 Types + Examples","url":"https://userpilot.com/blog/progress-bar-ui-ux-saas/"},{"title":"How to create progress indicator UI for better usability?","url":"https://cieden.com/book/atoms/progress-indicator/progress-indicator-ui"},{"title":"Progress bar | UI Design & Patterns | User Experience Toolkit for Insights Hub and Industrial IoT","url":"https://design.mindsphere.io/patterns/progressbar.html"},{"title":"Progress indicators | Apple Developer Documentation","url":"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/progress-indicators"},{"title":"Progress Bar Indicator UX/UI Design & Feedback Notifications","url":"https://usersnap.com/blog/progress-indicators/"},{"title":"Loading & progress indicators — UI Components series | by Taras Bakusevych | UX Collective","url":"https://uxdesign.cc/loading-progress-indicators-ui-components-series-f4b1fc35339a"},{"title":"Awesome progress bars that will inspire you - Justinmind","url":"https://www.justinmind.com/ui-design/progress-bars"},{"title":"10 Usability Heuristics Every UX/UI Designer Should Know in 2024 | by Hriday Checker | Bootcamp | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/10-usability-heuristics-every-ux-ui-designer-should-know-in-2024-ceca84cf96aa"}]},"Based on the search results, I've found comprehensive information about concurrent progress indicators, UI design for multiple loading states, and UX patterns for coordination in 2024.
