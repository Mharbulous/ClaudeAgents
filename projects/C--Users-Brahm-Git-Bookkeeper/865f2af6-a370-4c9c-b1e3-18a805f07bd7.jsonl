Create folder hierarchies like \"Document Type > Date > Institution\"\n2. Instantly reorganize to \"Date > Document Type > Institution\"\n3. Bookmark frequently used folder configurations\n4. Navigate complex hierarchies with enhanced breadcrumbs\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Development Principles\n- Each version is fully functional and deployable\n- No breaking changes to previous functionality\n- User can upgrade incrementally and see immediate value\n- Simple implementations preferred over complex optimizations\n\n### Technical Approach\n- Build on existing Vue 3/Vuetify architecture\n- Leverage existing Firebase infrastructure\n- Use existing authentication and team isolation\n- Follow established component patterns\n\n### Quality Assurance\n- Each version includes comprehensive testing\n- User acceptance testing before moving to next version\n- Performance benchmarking for scalability features\n- Legal workflow validation for BATES numbering features\n\n### Timeline Considerations\n- Version 1.0-1.2: Core foundation (2-3 weeks each)\n- Version 1.3-1.5: AI integration (3-4 weeks each) \n- Version 1.6-1.7: User interface enhancements (2 weeks each)\n- Version 1.8+: Advanced features (2-4 weeks each)\n\nThis phased approach ensures users get value from early versions while building toward the complete feature set described in the reference document.","numLines":305,"startLine":1,"totalLines":305}}}

User navigates to Organizer view\n2. Sees list of all uploaded files\n3. Clicks on a file to add tags (simple text input)\n4. Can filter file list by typing tag names\n\n---\n\n## Version 1.1: Category-Based Tag System\n\n**Core Goal**: Structure tags into user-defined categories\n\n**New Features**:\n- Category creation interface (user defines category names like \"Document Type\", \"Date\")\n- Tags now belong to categories instead of being free-form text\n- Category management (add/edit/delete categories)\n- Tag assignment limited to predefined category options\n- Color coding by category (simple distinct colors)\n\n**Implementation Scope**:\n- Category management interface\n- Update tag storage to include category reference\n- Color assignment system for categories\n- Modified tag assignment UI to show category groupings\n\n**User Flow**:\n1. User creates categories (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Institution\")\n2. For each category, defines available tags (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\")\n3. Tags files by selecting from category dropdown options\n4. Files display with color-coded tags grouped by category\n\n---\n\n## Version 1.2: AI Categorization (Manual Trigger)\n\n**Core Goal**: Let AI suggest tags for selected files\n\n**New Features**:\n- \"Process with AI\" button for selected files\n- Integration with Google Gemini API for document analysis\n- AI suggests tags based on existing category structure\n- Simple approval interface - user accepts or rejects AI suggestions\n- Manual processing only (user must trigger)\n\n**Implementation Scope**:\n- Gemini API integration\n- File selection interface\n- AI processing queue with progress tracking\n- Suggestion review interface\n- Batch processing capability\n\n**User Flow**:\n1. User selects files for AI processing\n2. Chooses which categories AI should analyze\n3. AI processes files and suggests appropriate tags\n4. User reviews and approves/rejects suggestions\n5. Approved tags are applied to files\n\n---\n\n## Version 1.3: Virtual Folder View\n\n**Core Goal**: Present tags as familiar folder structures\n\n**New Features**:\n- \"Show in Folders\" option when right-clicking tags\n- Dynamic folder hierarchy based on selected tag categories\n- Breadcrumb navigation in folder view\n- Switch between flat view and folder view\n- Folder view shows only files matching current folder context\n\n**Implementation Scope**:\n- Folder view component\n- Tag-to-folder conversion logic\n- Navigation breadcrumbs\n- View toggle between flat/folder modes\n\n**User Flow**:\n1. From flat view, right-click any tag and select \"Show in Folders\"\n2. View reorganizes into folder structure based on that tag category\n3. Navigate through folders using breadcrumbs\n4. Switch back to flat view anytime\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Version 1.4: Confidence-Based Routing\n\n**Core Goal**: Automatically handle high-confidence AI results, route uncertain ones for review\n\n**New Features**:\n- Confidence threshold settings (user-configurable)\n- Automatic application of high-confidence tags (>90%)\n- \"Human Review Required\" virtual folder for uncertain classifications\n- Three-option review interface (Accept AI suggestion, Other option, Create new category)\n\n**Implementation Scope**:\n- Confidence threshold configuration\n- Automatic vs manual routing logic\n- Human review queue interface\n- Enhanced suggestion interface with confidence display\n\n**User Flow**:\n1. AI processes files automatically applying high-confidence tags\n2. Medium/low confidence files appear in \"Human Review Required\" folder\n3. User reviews uncertain files with suggested options\n4. Can create new categories during review process\n\n---\n\n## Version 1.5: Context-Enhanced Processing\n\n**Core Goal**: Use previous classifications to improve AI accuracy\n\n**New Features**:\n- Second-pass processing for medium-confidence files\n- Uses previously classified examples as context for Gemini\n- Prioritizes human classifications over AI classifications in context\n- Learning system without model retraining\n\n**Implementation Scope**:\n- Context example selection algorithm\n- Two-pass processing workflow\n- Example formatting for Gemini context\n- Classification history tracking\n\n**User Flow**:\n1. AI first pass: High confidence files auto-tagged\n2. AI second pass: Medium confidence files processed with context examples\n3. Only remaining uncertain files go to human review\n4. System progressively gets better as more examples accumulate\n\n---\n\n## Version 1.6: Basic Document Viewer\n\n**Core Goal**: View documents without downloading\n\n**New Features**:\n- In-app document viewer for PDFs and images\n- Basic zoom and pagination controls\n- View documents directly from file list\n- Simple modal or dedicated view page\n\n**Implementation Scope**:\n- PDF viewer component integration\n- Image display component\n- Modal or route-based viewer interface\n- File type detection and appropriate viewer selection\n\n**User Flow**:\n1. Click on any file in list to view\n2. PDFs open with pagination and zoom controls\n3. Images display with zoom capability\n4. Close viewer to return to file list\n\n---\n\n## Version 1.7: BATES Numbering System\n\n**Core Goal**: Legal document numbering for printed outputs\n\n**New Features**:\n- BATES prefix configuration per team/matter\n- Sequential numbering system\n- Print-to-PDF with BATES stamps\n- Immutable number assignment after first print\n- No raw downloads - only BATES-stamped prints\n\n**Implementation Scope**:\n- BATES numbering configuration interface\n- PDF generation service with stamp overlay\n- Number assignment and tracking system\n- Print-only download restrictions\n\n**User Flow**:\n1. Configure BATES prefix for current matter\n2. Print documents get sequential numbers (e.g., \"Roberts-0001\")\n3. Same document always prints with same number\n4. All downloads are BATES-stamped PDFs only\n\n---\n\n## Version 1.8: Advanced Tag Management\n\n**Core Goal**: Comprehensive tag lifecycle management\n\n**New Features**:\n- Add new tags to existing categories with reprocessing option\n- Delete tags with reassignment workflow\n- Merge tags through delete-and-reprocess\n- Tag usage analytics and cleanup suggestions\n\n**Implementation Scope**:\n- Tag modification workflows\n- Reprocessing trigger system\n- Tag migration and cleanup tools\n- Usage tracking and reporting\n\n**User Flow**:\n1. Add new tag to category → option to reprocess existing files\n2. Delete tag → choose how to handle affected files\n3. System suggests cleanup for unused or redundant tags\n4.
