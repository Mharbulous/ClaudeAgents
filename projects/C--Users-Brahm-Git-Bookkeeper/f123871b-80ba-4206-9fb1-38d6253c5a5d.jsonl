However I have noticed a problem. The upload system works great on files that are stored locally on your local hard drive but if you're trying to duplicate files from your local hard drive and those files are on a folder that is actually a 1 drive folder that is synced to the cloud in other words the files are not directly saved on your computer they're kind of stored on the cloud of Onedrive and downloaded as needed. With those kinds of files my folder upload estimator system just seems to process forever and never actually finishes Is there an obvious explanation for this or obvious way to deal with it Or an obvious fix is this something that you will need to do some research on the Internet to find out how One drive works and then figure out how we could get our upload system to work with file that are on 1 DR folders that are currently being synced with the cloud"},"uuid":"5aa52b12-3ef2-485f-90ac-2bac2e250d1e","timestamp":"2025-08-24T22:42:01.236Z"}

Here's what I found:\n\n## OneDrive Files On-Demand Overview\n\nOneDrive Files On-Demand helps you access all the files in your cloud storage in OneDrive without having to download them and use storage space on your computer. Starting with OneDrive build 23.066 Files On-Demand is enabled by default for all users.\n\n## How Files On-Demand Works\n\nWith Files On-Demand, you'll see all your files as online-only files in File Explorer, but they won't take up space. When you're connected to the Internet, you'll be able to use the files like every other file on your device.\n\nOneDrive Files On-Demand enables users to view, search for, and interact with files stored in OneDrive from within File Explorer, without downloading all the files to their device. The feature provides a seamless look and feel for both OneDrive and local files without taking up space on the local hard drive.\n\n## File System Behavior and Status Icons\n\nThe system uses different status indicators to show file availability:\n\nFiles that haven't been downloaded have a cloud icon for their status. For those files that have been downloaded, the status shows a green checkmark.\n\nThis results in the file status icons (blue cloud = online only; green tick = downloaded; solid green circle with white tick = always keep on device) being shown separately from the file icon.\n\n## File Download Behavior\n\nFiles are downloaded to the device if a user opens them or chooses the option to \"Always keep on this device\" from the context menu in File Explorer. When you open an online-only file, it downloads to your device and becomes locally available.\n\nBy default, files are downloaded only when you need to access them. However, if you plan to access a file while disconnected from the internet, make the file available offline by right-clicking it, and then selecting Always keep on this device.\n\n## Web Browser and Application Access\n\nFiles On-Demand also allows you to open online files from within desktop or Windows store apps using the Windows file picker. Simply select the file you want to open in the file picker, and the file will automatically download and open in your app.\n\nUsers can upload, download, and interact with OneDrive files from a web browser, but the ideal OneDrive experience comes from the Windows and Mac sync apps and the iOS and Android mobile apps.\n\n## File Management Options\n\nAfter this change, users who have Files On-Demand enabled will see two buttons: Free up disk space: This is the default and recommended behavior. New files from the cloud are online-only by default, not taking up disk space.\n\nThe Free up disk space button sets all your OneDrive files to online-only. In other words, it turns on Files On-Demand in OneDrive.\n\nThe search results provide comprehensive information about how OneDrive Files On-Demand works at the file system level, its integration with File Explorer, and how it manages storage space while maintaining seamless access to cloud-stored files."}]},"uuid":"3e183c56-5f49-40c2-b868-34d1735476c6","timestamp":"2025-08-24T22:42:33.518Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"OneDrive Files On-Demand how it works file system behavior web browser file access","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01GAnNoEVvHbnHR7mf9DjfEP","content":[{"title":"Save disk space with OneDrive Files On-Demand for Windows - Microsoft Support","url":"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-disk-space-with-onedrive-files-on-demand-for-windows-0e6860d3-d9f3-4971-b321-7092438fb38e"},{"title":"Change in Files On-Demand behaviour in recent update to OneDrive for Windows | Microsoft Community Hub","url":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/onedriveforbusiness/change-in-files-on-demand-behaviour-in-recent-update-to-onedrive-for-windows/3976707"},{"title":"OneDrive Files On-Demand - UConn Knowledge Base","url":"https://kb.uconn.edu/space/IKB/26228721112/OneDrive+Files+On-Demand"},{"title":"How does Files On-Demand work? – IT Service","url":"https://it.wp.worc.ac.uk/ask-a-question/storage/onedrive-files-on-demand/"},{"title":"Set OneDrive to On-Demand in Windows","url":"https://kb.uconn.edu/space/IKB/10836574241/Set+OneDrive+to+On-Demand+in+Windows"},{"title":"OneDrive: Use Files On-Demand – with Convenience Options","url":"https://hansbrender.com/2024/12/04/onedrive-use-files-on-demand-with-convenience-options/"},{"title":"Enable or Disable OneDrive Files On-Demand in Windows 11 | Windows 11 Forum","url":"https://www.elevenforum.com/t/enable-or-disable-onedrive-files-on-demand-in-windows-11.4371/"},{"title":"What is OneDrive's Files On-Demand feature and how to use it","url":"https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-use-files-demand-windows-onedrive-file-explorer/"},{"title":"Introducing OneDrive Files On-Demand and other features making it easy to access files | Microsoft 365 Blog","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2017/05/11/introducing-onedrive-files-on-demand-and-additional-features-making-it-easier-to-access-and-share-files/"},{"title":"Overview of OneDrive in Microsoft 365 - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/onedrive-overview"}]},"I've performed a web search on OneDrive Files On-Demand, focusing on how it works, file system behavior, and web browser file access.

This web browser does not support JavaScript, or scripts are being blocked.\"\n\n### 5. **Security and Permissions Concerns**\n\nThe official OneDrive File Picker implementation requests read access to the entire drive — even when uploading just a single file — due to the lack of fine-grained OAuth scopes for OneDrive.(no content)OneDrive File Picker's latest version requires developers to handle user authentication via a tool that stores sensitive secrets in the browser insecurely, with tokens enabling attackers to gain long-term access to all files in a user's OneDrive.\n\n### 6. **On-Demand Files Specific Issues**\n\nWhile the search didn't return specific details about on-demand files processing issues, opening or saving files within Desktop or Documents folders can cause the file's app to freeze, particularly occurring on macOS 15.\n\n## Recommended Solutions:\n\n1. **For infinite processing loops**: Check browser compatibility, disable security features like Protected Mode temporarily, and ensure proper OAuth flow completion\n2. **For rate limiting**: Consider using batch requests or reducing API call frequency\n3. **For browser issues**: Use supported browsers or implement browser-specific workarounds\n4. **For CORS problems**: Verify domain whitelisting and proper API endpoint configuration\n5. **For JavaScript blocking**: Ensure script permissions are enabled and security extensions allow OneDrive scripts\n\nThese issues appear to be ongoing challenges with OneDrive's web integration, particularly affecting enterprise environments and cross-browser compatibility."],"durationSeconds":27.63631779999999}}

Users report that \"after complete the authentication process on the new window, it's stopped and only show me the loading\" and \"the request is hanging indefinitely\".\n\n## OneDrive Placeholder Files Background\n\nOneDrive previously included \"placeholder\" files - very small files that locally represent cloud-stored files, containing only thumbnails and metadata pointing to the original file. These became problematic because users didn't realize placeholders weren't actual files, requiring double-clicking to trigger downloads, and files were inaccessible without internet connection.\n\n## JavaScript and Browser Compatibility Issues\n\nOneDrive JavaScript errors can occur due to problems with JavaScript or VBScript code in the OneDrive application, potentially caused by actual code-related issues or Internet connection problems. The OneDrive application and Internet Explorer use the same Internet connection settings, meaning corrupted IE settings can cause OneDrive breakdowns.\n\n## File API and ArrayBuffer Operations\n\nThe arrayBuffer() method of the Response interface reads a Response stream to completion and returns a promise that resolves with an ArrayBuffer. FileReader's readAsArrayBuffer() method reads Blob or File contents, and when finished, the result property contains an ArrayBuffer representing the file's data.\n\n## Browser Hang Prevention\n\nOneDrive File Picker code must be called as part of an explicit user action to avoid being blocked by pop-up blockers, and if the SDK is not present on page load (lazy loaded), the picker may not properly open.\n\nThe search results indicate that timeout and infinite loading issues with OneDrive placeholder files in JavaScript applications are well-documented problems, particularly with the File Picker SDK v7.2, often related to authentication flows, browser compatibility, and proper SDK initialization."}]},"uuid":"e76cd67d-0dbe-4f93-a611-27c356d1d0a9","timestamp":"2025-08-24T22:50:11.615Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"File API\" \"arrayBuffer\" timeout \"OneDrive\" \"placeholder files\" browser hang infinite loading JavaScript","results":["I'll search for information about File API, arrayBuffer, timeout issues with OneDrive placeholder files causing browser hangs and infinite loading in JavaScript.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_017GtnJpj6XsEH2SvQVe7LCx","content":[{"title":"OneDrive file picker never finishes loading on IE11 and Edge · Issue #755 · OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs","url":"https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/755"},{"title":"File Picker SDK for JavaScript - OneDrive - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/controls/file-pickers/js-v72/?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"Upload small files - OneDrive API - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/api/driveitem_put_content?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"Response: arrayBuffer() method - Web APIs | MDN","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/arrayBuffer"},{"title":"OneDrive File Picker v7.2 doesn't finish to load the picker into PWA · Issue #896 · OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs","url":"https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/896"},{"title":"onedrive-api - npm","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/onedrive-api"},{"title":"Open from OneDrive in JavaScript - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/controls/file-pickers/js-v72/open-file?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"Save to OneDrive from JavaScript - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/controls/file-pickers/js-v72/save-file?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"FileSystemFileHandle - Web APIs | MDN","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemFileHandle"},{"title":"Uploading files - OneDrive API - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/concepts/upload?view=odsp-graph-online"}]},"I found several relevant results about OneDrive File Picker issues and File API arrayBuffer operations.

This is a fundamental limitation of the web browser environment compared to native Windows applications.\n\n### Windows-Level Detection Methods (Not Available in Browsers)\n\nAt the Windows system level, OneDrive Files On-Demand placeholders can be detected using specific file attributes:\n\n- FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS attribute is used to determine if a file or directory is completely present locally or not\n- When this attribute is set, it means that the file or directory is not fully present locally\n- PKEY_StorageProviderState rather than PKEY_FilePlaceholderStatus can be used for OneDrive attributes via the shell\n- FILE_ATTRIBUTE_PINNED is used by OneDrive to indicate a file that's \"always available\"\n\nHowever, these Windows API methods are not accessible through browser JavaScript.\n\n### OneDrive Files On-Demand Behavior\n\nWindows 10/11 has support for cloud-based filesystems, so whether you use OneDrive, Dropbox or Google Drive -- they use the same API to the Windows filesystem. The API introduces the concept of hydration, a file can be locally stored or serves as a placeholder (on demand).\n\nDehydrated files or folders only provide you with their name, date, file size and limited attributes, and if you perform any file operation to browse on-demand files (or index their contents), it will trigger a sync download.\n\n### Browser JavaScript File API Constraints\n\nThe standard JavaScript File API in browsers cannot access the low-level Windows file system attributes that would indicate whether a file is a OneDrive placeholder. The File API is sandboxed and only provides access to basic file properties like:\n\n- `name`\n- `size`\n- `type`\n- `lastModified`\n\nThese properties don't include the Windows-specific attributes needed to detect placeholder status.\n\n### Alternative Approaches\n\nThe search results suggest several workarounds, though none provide direct placeholder detection in the browser:\n\n1. **OneDrive File Picker SDK**: The OneDrive file picker makes it easy for your web app to connect to content stored in OneDrive and SharePoint. Using the file picker you can open, save, and share files stored in OneDrive or SharePoint without writing custom file UI code\n\n2. **Microsoft Graph API**: You can use the action value query along with setting the queryParameters of the advanced object to return a custom set of properties from the API about the selected object\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Direct detection of OneDrive Files On-Demand placeholder files through JavaScript browser File API properties and attributes is not possible.** The browser's security model prevents access to the Windows-specific file system attributes that indicate placeholder status. \n\nFor web applications needing to work with OneDrive files, the recommended approach is to use the OneDrive File Picker SDK or Microsoft Graph API, which provide proper integration with OneDrive services without requiring direct file system access."}]},"uuid":"7062753c-41e5-40dd-bfe9-f22fc2872b57","timestamp":"2025-08-24T22:56:11.977Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"detect OneDrive Files On-Demand placeholder files JavaScript browser File API properties attributes","results":["I'll perform a web search for information about detecting OneDrive Files On-Demand placeholder files using JavaScript browser File API properties and attributes.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_016r9KVBwDoAg3hzHe87d3Yn","content":[{"title":"File Picker SDK for JavaScript - OneDrive - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/controls/file-pickers/js-v72/?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"Open from OneDrive in JavaScript - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/controls/file-pickers/js-v72/open-file?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"Set Files On-Demand states in Windows - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/files-on-demand-windows"},{"title":"Any workaround as to how to keep track on OneDrive on demand files - Windows 10 Help Forums","url":"https://www.tenforums.com/network-sharing/206953-any-workaround-how-keep-track-onedrive-demand-files.html"},{"title":"Save to OneDrive from JavaScript - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/controls/file-pickers/js-v72/save-file?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"winapi - How to detect OneDrive online-only files - Stack Overflow","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49301958/how-to-detect-onedrive-online-only-files"},{"title":"How to address resources - OneDrive API - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/concepts/addressing-driveitems?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"onedrive-api-docs/docs/controls/file-pickers/js-v72/open-file.md at live · OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs","url":"https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/blob/live/docs/controls/file-pickers/js-v72/open-file.md"},{"title":"GitHub - OneDrive/onedrive-explorer-js: OneDrive sample application for JavaScript.","url":"https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-explorer-js"},{"title":"OneDrive file storage API overview - Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/onedrive-concept-overview"}]},"Based on the search results, I can see information about OneDrive Files On-Demand and file detection, but I need to search more specifically for JavaScript browser File API detection methods.

Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n## Performance Issues with ArrayBuffer Operations\n\nOn desktop browsers, readAsArrayBuffer operations can achieve speeds around 4MB/s, but on mobile Chrome for Android, this drops significantly to around 90KB/s. When processing large files (1GB or larger), pages might crash in browsers or not function correctly because readAsText() loads the full file into memory before processing it, causing process memory to exceed limitations.\n\n## Optimization Strategies\n\nOne approach is slicing bigger chunks and splitting them manually from ArrayBuffer into required ones.

Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n## Performance Issues with ArrayBuffer Operations\n\nOn desktop browsers, readAsArrayBuffer operations can achieve speeds around 4MB/s, but on mobile Chrome for Android, this drops significantly to around 90KB/s. When processing large files (1GB or larger), pages might crash in browsers or not function correctly because readAsText() loads the full file into memory before processing it, causing process memory to exceed limitations.\n\n## Optimization Strategies\n\nOne approach is slicing bigger chunks and splitting them manually from ArrayBuffer into required ones. For large file processing, using FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer() instead of readAsText() can help prevent memory issues.\n\n## OneDrive API Integration\n\nThe OneDrive API can be used with XMLHttpRequest to download files, setting the responseType to 'arraybuffer' for binary data handling.

This returned promise settles with the eventual state of the first promise that settles.(no content)The Promise.race() method returns a promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in an iterable fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.\n\n**File ArrayBuffer Processing:**\nThe arrayBuffer() method of the Response interface takes a Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise that resolves with an ArrayBuffer.\n\n## Implementation Patterns\n\nThe search results show several patterns for implementing timeouts with AbortController:\n\n1. **Basic timeout with AbortSignal.timeout():**\nconst res = await fetch(url, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(5000) });\n\n2. **Promise.race with manual abort:**\nconst res = await Promise.race([ sleep(3000), getData(signal,3000) ]); if(res === timedOut) { abortController.abort(); }\n\n3. **Combining multiple signals:**\nsignal: AbortSignal.any([signal, AbortSignal.timeout(5000)])\n\nThe search results indicate this is a common pattern for handling file operations with timeout controls, particularly useful for OneDrive file processing where network delays might occur.

Performance-Based Detection:**\n- `file.arrayBuffer()` timing analysis - local files process in <50ms, OneDrive placeholders can take >1000ms\n- Network activity patterns during file access\n- `FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer()` performance monitoring (mobile Chrome: ~90KB/s vs desktop: ~4MB/s)\n\n**2. Timeout-Based Pattern Recognition:**\n- `Promise.race()` with timeout detection using `AbortController`\n- `AbortSignal.timeout()` for automatic timeout handling\n- File operations that consistently exceed timeout thresholds indicate potential OneDrive placeholders\n\n**3. Behavioral Analysis:**\n- Batch processing speed inconsistencies (some files instant, others hang)\n- Sequential vs random slow file patterns\n- Network connectivity correlation with file access delays\n\n**4. User Environment Heuristics:**\n- Windows platform detection (where OneDrive Files On-Demand is most common)  \n- User agent analysis combined with file access timing patterns\n- Interactive detection after processing starts\n\n### Research Gaps Identified\n\n**Limited Documentation:**\n- No standardized browser APIs for cloud-synced file detection\n- Sparse documentation on `file.arrayBuffer()` timeout behaviors with OneDrive\n- No established best practices for web apps handling Files On-Demand\n\n**Technical Limitations:**\n- Browser security prevents path-based OneDrive folder detection\n- No JavaScript APIs to distinguish local vs placeholder files directly\n- Cannot access Windows filesystem attributes from browser context\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Direct detection is impossible** due to browser security limitations. **Indirect detection through timing analysis and timeout patterns appears to be the only viable approach**, though it would be heuristic-based rather than definitive.

The API allows you to retrieve file metadata without necessarily downloading the full file content, which is particularly useful for Files On-Demand implementations.\n\nFor checking download status in your JavaScript application, you would typically examine properties like:\n- File size and availability indicators\n- Download URLs and their accessibility\n- Metadata that indicates local vs. cloud storage state\n\nThe search results indicate this is an active area of Microsoft Graph API development for managing OneDrive Files On-Demand scenarios through JavaScript applications."],"durationSeconds":13.70103330000001}}

The correct method to use depends on where the content is coming from and how large the contents of the item are.\n\n### Upload Options:\n1. **Simple Upload**: Simple item upload is available for items with less than 4 MB of content.\n2. **Resumable Upload**: Resumable item upload is provided for large files or when a resumable transfer may be necessary.\n3. **Multipart Upload**: Multipart item upload allows you to upload both the contents of an item and provide metadata about the item in the same call. This is only available for OneDrive Personal.\n4. **Upload from URL**: Upload from URL (preview) allows you to upload the contents of a file by providing a URL where the contents of the file can be retrieved.\n\n## JavaScript SDK Implementation\n\nFor this example, I will use the Microsoft Graph API with Javascript. Here you first need to use some Authorization Framework like MSALJS to get a Token for Microsoft Graph.\n\n### Browser Detection and Status Handling\n\nWith this Token, you start calling the Graph API calls createUploadSession. The official documentation says, that you need to use a POST Command. The last time I tried it only worked with a PUT Command.(no content)This is especially useful for mobile clients or browser add-ins, where the file contents aren't available, or are expensive to transfer.\n\n### Upload Session Status Monitoring\n\nWhen the request is complete, the server responds with 202 Accepted if there are more byte ranges that need to be uploaded.(no content)When the upload is completed, the server responds to the final request with an HTTP 201 Created or HTTP 200 OK. The response body will also include the default property set for the driveItem representing the completed file.\n\n### Cloud vs Local File Detection\n\nThe API provides several mechanisms for handling file status:\n- OneDrive personal users can add one or more shared items from another drive to their own OneDrive. These shared items appear as a DriveItem in the children collection with a remoteItem facet.\n- OneDrive users can access their files from any device, online or offline, and share files with people inside or outside their organization.\n\n### JavaScript SDK Code Example\n\nconst options = { authProvider, }; const client = Client.init(options); const stream = The contents of the file goes here.; await client.api('/me/drive/items/{item-id}/content') .put(stream);\n\nThe search results show that Microsoft Graph API provides comprehensive file upload capabilities for OneDrive through JavaScript SDK, with support for different upload methods, browser compatibility, status monitoring, and handling of both cloud and local file scenarios."}]},"uuid":"c1303313-b2e9-4009-908f-c8b31b6035c4","timestamp":"2025-08-24T22:59:46.229Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Microsoft Graph API JavaScript SDK OneDrive file upload browser detect cloud local status","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Qzko3EUPjxtACRpzzdQLTc","content":[{"title":"Access OneDrive and SharePoint via Microsoft Graph API - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"OneDrive file storage API overview - Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/onedrive-concept-overview"},{"title":"Get started using OneDrive API - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/getting-started/?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"Uploading files - OneDrive API - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/concepts/upload?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"driveItem: createUploadSession - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-createuploadsession?view=graph-rest-1.0"},{"title":"Working with files in Microsoft Graph - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/onedrive?view=graph-rest-1.0"},{"title":"Upload small files - OneDrive API - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/api/driveitem_put_content?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"How To Upload Files To OneDrive Or SharePoint Using Microsoft Graph API And CSOM | by Carsten Cleve | How-To’s | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/how-tos/how-to-upload-files-to-onedrive-or-sharepoint-using-microsoft-graph-api-and-csom-1d052b21e0a8"},{"title":"Upload from a URL - OneDrive API - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/api/driveitem_upload_url?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"Upload small files - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-put-content?view=graph-rest-1.0"}]},"Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Microsoft Graph API file upload capabilities with JavaScript SDK for OneDrive.

The REST API is shared between OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, SharePoint document libraries, and Office Groups. The OneDrive file picker makes it easy for your web app to connect to content stored in OneDrive and SharePoint. Using the file picker you can open, save, and share files stored in OneDrive or SharePoint without writing custom file UI code.\n\n### Dropbox API  \nDropbox API allows developers to work with files in Dropbox, including advanced functionality like full-text search, thumbnails, and sharing. Dropbox provides various APIs and SDKs that allow developers to easily access user data upon authorization. The Chooser is the fastest way to get files from Dropbox into your web app. It's a small JavaScript component that enables your app to get files from Dropbox without having to worry about the complexities of implementing a file browser, authentication, or managing uploads and storage.\n\n### Placeholder Files and Sync Challenges\nThe user saves a document to OneDrive, and the application provides a list of recently opened documents, which when clicked causes the application to programmatically open the file. Most applications are not aware of placeholders and expect the files to be automatically hydrated whenever needed. If the user has dehydrated a file and tries to open it from the list of recently opened documents in the application, then the application will fail.\n\n### JavaScript Browser Limitations\nFor automatic syncing in JavaScript applications, there are significant limitations:\n\nWith the Dropbox Javascript API, you have to poll for changes and then pull the changes. It seems also with the Google Drive Javascript API that you need to watch for changes and then get those changes. Using the Dropbox JavaScript SDK you need to poll for changes and then pull those changes into your app's local state.\n\n### Browser Compatibility\nNot all browsers support the Chooser. If a user's browser doesn't support the Chooser, we'll gray out the button and show a warning message if you try to call Dropbox.choose(). You can check to see if the user's browser is supported by calling Dropbox.isBrowserSupported().\n\nThe key challenge with placeholder files is that browser-based JavaScript applications cannot reliably detect or handle cloud storage placeholder files (files that exist in the cloud but haven't been downloaded locally) without proper API integration and polling mechanisms. None of the major cloud storage providers offer true automatic syncing for JavaScript applications - they all require manual polling for changes."}]},"uuid":"6815ec52-b87e-40d4-97ed-e795d3933214","timestamp":"2025-08-24T23:06:06.358Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"Cloud Files API\" OneDrive Dropbox placeholder files detection JavaScript browser","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01QWHyZpdbUX8vDEYV2hgLWh","content":[{"title":"How to Implement Cloud APIs: Google Drive API, Dropbox API, and OneDrive API | HackerNoon","url":"https://hackernoon.com/how-to-implement-cloud-apis-google-drive-api-dropbox-api-and-onedrive-api"},{"title":"Top 5 file storage APIs to integrate with","url":"https://www.apideck.com/blog/top-5-file-storage-apis-to-integrate-with"},{"title":"Which (if any) Javascript storage API (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) provides automatic syncing? - Stack Overflow","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24481923/which-if-any-javascript-storage-api-google-drive-dropbox-onedrive-provides"},{"title":"Top 10 Cloud API: Google Drive, Dropbox, BOX and others | by Yasu | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@yasunaka.cho.rakuten/top-10-cloud-api-google-drive-dropbox-box-and-others-c2721801e83a"},{"title":"HTTP - Developers - Dropbox","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation"},{"title":"Chooser - Developers - Dropbox","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/developers/chooser"},{"title":"Show HN: One Adaptive API for Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive | Hacker News","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8442004"},{"title":"File Picker SDK for JavaScript - OneDrive - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/controls/file-pickers/js-v72/?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"How to address resources - OneDrive API - OneDrive dev center | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/concepts/addressing-driveitems?view=odsp-graph-online"},{"title":"Bug in Cloud Filer / Placeholder / Reparse Point Disguising / OneDrive sync engine · GitHub","url":"https://gist.github.com/GeeLaw/2b0c75c5cace89076d67014f775d85fc"}]},"Based on the search results, I can provide information about Cloud Files APIs for OneDrive, Dropbox, and their approaches to placeholder files detection in JavaScript browsers.\n\n## Cloud Files APIs for OneDrive, Dropbox, and Placeholder Files Detection\n\n### OneDrive API\nThe OneDrive REST API is a portion of the Microsoft Graph API which allows your app to connect to content stored in OneDrive and SharePoint.

Placeholder files present as typical files to apps and to end users in the Windows Shell.\n\n## FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS\n\nA tiered file has both the offline attribute and the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS attribute set in NTFS so that third-party applications can securely identify tiered files.(no content)The FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS has a value of 0x00400000 and is settable only by the OS (in this case by the OneDrive filter driver). It slightly modifies the meaning of the 'O' (Offline) attribute, by indicating that the offline file will be automatically made available as soon as its data is accessed, without having to explicitly request this via FSCTL_RECALL_FILE.(no content)FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS means that the file will be downloaded when needed.\n\n## Placeholder File States\n\nThe search results show three main states for placeholder files:\n\n- online-only FILE_ATTRIBUTE_PINNED : False FILE_ATTRIBUTE_UNPINNED : True FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS : True - locally available FILE_ATTRIBUTE_PINNED : False FILE_ATTRIBUTE_UNPINNED : False FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS : False - always available FILE_ATTRIBUTE_PINNED : True FILE_ATTRIBUTE_UNPINNED : False FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS : False\n\n## JavaScript/Node.js Integration Options\n\nFor working with Windows file attributes in JavaScript/Node.js, several approaches are available:\n\n### 1. Native Addons\nThe node-file-attributes package provides functionality through native addons for managing file attributes on Windows, such as hidden, system, read-only, archive, compression, and indexing. However, this package doesn't specifically mention support for the newer cloud file attributes.\n\n### 2. FFI (Foreign Function Interface)\nnode-ffi-napi is a Node.js addon for loading and calling dynamic libraries using pure JavaScript. It can be used to create bindings to native libraries without writing any C++ code.(no content)Using node-ffi, you can call Windows APIs directly from JavaScript, allowing you to access GetFileAttributes and other Windows API functions.\n\n### 3. Native C++ Addons\nAddons are dynamically-linked shared objects written in C++. The require() function can load addons as ordinary Node.js modules. Addons provide an interface between JavaScript and C/C++ libraries\n\n## Limitations and Challenges\n\nStandard Windows APIs like GetFileAttributes(), FindFirstFile(), and NtQueryAttributesFile() may not expose these new file attributes properly. The \"recall\" attributes may only be exposed when traversing the folder hierarchy and seem to be synthesized by the file system driver or a filter driver.(no content)There are challenges with setting FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS using standard APIs like SetFileAttributes, as it won't add this file attribute.\n\n## Practical Implementation\n\nFor detecting placeholder files with FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS in JavaScript, you would likely need to:\n\n1.

Placeholder files present as typical files to apps and to end users in the Windows Shell.\n\n## FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS\n\nA tiered file has both the offline attribute and the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS attribute set in NTFS so that third-party applications can securely identify tiered files.(no content)The FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS has a value of 0x00400000 and is settable only by the OS (in this case by the OneDrive filter driver). It slightly modifies the meaning of the 'O' (Offline) attribute, by indicating that the offline file will be automatically made available as soon as its data is accessed, without having to explicitly request this via FSCTL_RECALL_FILE.(no content)FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS means that the file will be downloaded when needed.\n\n## Placeholder File States\n\nThe search results show three main states for placeholder files:\n\n- online-only FILE_ATTRIBUTE_PINNED : False FILE_ATTRIBUTE_UNPINNED : True FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS : True - locally available FILE_ATTRIBUTE_PINNED : False FILE_ATTRIBUTE_UNPINNED : False FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS : False - always available FILE_ATTRIBUTE_PINNED : True FILE_ATTRIBUTE_UNPINNED : False FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS : False\n\n## JavaScript/Node.js Integration Options\n\nFor working with Windows file attributes in JavaScript/Node.js, several approaches are available:\n\n### 1. Native Addons\nThe node-file-attributes package provides functionality through native addons for managing file attributes on Windows, such as hidden, system, read-only, archive, compression, and indexing. However, this package doesn't specifically mention support for the newer cloud file attributes.\n\n### 2. FFI (Foreign Function Interface)\nnode-ffi-napi is a Node.js addon for loading and calling dynamic libraries using pure JavaScript. It can be used to create bindings to native libraries without writing any C++ code.(no content)Using node-ffi, you can call Windows APIs directly from JavaScript, allowing you to access GetFileAttributes and other Windows API functions.\n\n### 3. Native C++ Addons\nAddons are dynamically-linked shared objects written in C++. The require() function can load addons as ordinary Node.js modules. Addons provide an interface between JavaScript and C/C++ libraries\n\n## Limitations and Challenges\n\nStandard Windows APIs like GetFileAttributes(), FindFirstFile(), and NtQueryAttributesFile() may not expose these new file attributes properly. The \"recall\" attributes may only be exposed when traversing the folder hierarchy and seem to be synthesized by the file system driver or a filter driver.(no content)There are challenges with setting FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS using standard APIs like SetFileAttributes, as it won't add this file attribute.\n\n## Practical Implementation\n\nFor detecting placeholder files with FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS in JavaScript, you would likely need to:\n\n1. Use node-ffi-napi to call Windows APIs directly\n2. Access GetFileAttributes or similar functions from kernel32.dll\n3. Check for the specific attribute flag (0x00400000)\n4. Handle the fact that these attributes may be filtered or masked by Windows compatibility layers\n\nThere is non-trivial overhead associated with FFI calls, with native hard-coded bindings being orders of magnitude faster, so there's a significant cost in FFI calls.\n\nThe Cloud Files API is primarily designed for desktop applications and does not currently support implementing cloud sync engines in UWP apps. Cloud sync engines must be implemented in desktop apps."],"durationSeconds":47.90542470000009}}

Here's what I found:\n\n## ArrayBuffer and Memory Management\n\nThe ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic raw binary data buffer.(no content)ArrayBuffer objects can be transferred between different execution contexts, like Web Workers or Service Workers, using the structured clone algorithm. This is done by passing the ArrayBuffer as a transferable object in a call to Worker.postMessage() or ServiceWorker.postMessage().\n\n## Browser Memory Limitations\n\nDoes anyone know if the signed int32 restriction for ArrayBuffer sizes is Firefox's own limitation, or is there some specific reason that we can't go higher? Or would it be possible to just change Firefox to expand the max size to be 4GB-1byte? The search results reveal that V8 keeps the 2^31-1 limit on 32-bit but boosts it to the full 2^53-1 range on 64-bit, and this is now available in Nightly when setting javascript.options.large_arraybuffers to true (requires a browser restart). Pref is on by default starting in FF89.\n\n## Concurrent Processing and SharedArrayBuffer\n\nFor concurrent processing, SharedArrayBuffer changed this paradigm by introducing true shared memory capabilities. SharedArrayBuffer represents a fixed-length raw binary data buffer that can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. Unlike regular ArrayBuffer, which creates isolated copies when transferred between threads, SharedArrayBuffer provides a shared view of the same memory space.\n\nHowever, there are memory management concerns: Running the same code using ArrayBuffer instead of SharedArrayBuffer runs perfectly fine without any significant memory usage. This issue goes away for me when passing the --no-concurrent-array-buffer-sweeping --no-concurrent-array-buffer-freeing flags to Node.js, so I think it's safe to say that this is a V8 bug.\n\n## Large File Processing and Browser Memory Limits\n\nWhen processing large files, when the file size grows to 1GB, or even 2GB, then the page might crash in browser or not function correctly. This is because readAsText() loads the full file into memory before processing it. As a result, the process memory exceeds the limitation.\n\nTo handle this, We can use Blob.slice() to cut the file into pieces for further processing. This chunked approach prevents memory overflow issues.\n\n## Memory Optimization Strategies\n\nIn order to save the memory, you can pack them into ArrayBuffer.

Here's what I found:\n\n## ArrayBuffer and Memory Management\n\nThe ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic raw binary data buffer.(no content)ArrayBuffer objects can be transferred between different execution contexts, like Web Workers or Service Workers, using the structured clone algorithm. This is done by passing the ArrayBuffer as a transferable object in a call to Worker.postMessage() or ServiceWorker.postMessage().\n\n## Browser Memory Limitations\n\nDoes anyone know if the signed int32 restriction for ArrayBuffer sizes is Firefox's own limitation, or is there some specific reason that we can't go higher? Or would it be possible to just change Firefox to expand the max size to be 4GB-1byte? The search results reveal that V8 keeps the 2^31-1 limit on 32-bit but boosts it to the full 2^53-1 range on 64-bit, and this is now available in Nightly when setting javascript.options.large_arraybuffers to true (requires a browser restart). Pref is on by default starting in FF89.\n\n## Concurrent Processing and SharedArrayBuffer\n\nFor concurrent processing, SharedArrayBuffer changed this paradigm by introducing true shared memory capabilities. SharedArrayBuffer represents a fixed-length raw binary data buffer that can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. Unlike regular ArrayBuffer, which creates isolated copies when transferred between threads, SharedArrayBuffer provides a shared view of the same memory space.\n\nHowever, there are memory management concerns: Running the same code using ArrayBuffer instead of SharedArrayBuffer runs perfectly fine without any significant memory usage. This issue goes away for me when passing the --no-concurrent-array-buffer-sweeping --no-concurrent-array-buffer-freeing flags to Node.js, so I think it's safe to say that this is a V8 bug.\n\n## Large File Processing and Browser Memory Limits\n\nWhen processing large files, when the file size grows to 1GB, or even 2GB, then the page might crash in browser or not function correctly. This is because readAsText() loads the full file into memory before processing it. As a result, the process memory exceeds the limitation.\n\nTo handle this, We can use Blob.slice() to cut the file into pieces for further processing. This chunked approach prevents memory overflow issues.\n\n## Memory Optimization Strategies\n\nIn order to save the memory, you can pack them into ArrayBuffer. They can help to reduce the memory usage of your application. Additionally, there are cases when ArrayBuffer comes in handy: Web Workers. You can pass array buffer directly to the web worker without copying the data!\n\nThe search results indicate that while there are theoretical limits and browser-specific constraints on ArrayBuffer sizes and concurrent processing, modern browsers have been expanding these limits, particularly for 64-bit processes. For OneDrive-style batch processing applications, using chunked file processing with ArrayBuffers and Web Workers appears to be the recommended approach to manage memory efficiently while maintaining concurrent processing capabilities."],"durationSeconds":29.42392529999977}}
