Rather than traditional folder storage, it uses a tag-based flat storage system with virtual folder presentations optimized for legal document management workflows.\n     6→\n     7→## Core Purpose\n     8→\n     9→**Primary Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.\n    10→\n    11→**Target Use Cases**:\n    12→- Finding bank statements by institution and account details\n    13→- Locating photographs by location and date\n    14→- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)\n    15→- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation\n    16→\n    17→## Architecture Overview\n    18→\n    19→### Storage Strategy\n    20→- **Flat File Storage**: All files stored in single Firebase Storage folder\n    21→- **Tag-Based Organization**: Organization achieved through metadata tags, not physical folders\n    22→- **Virtual Folder Presentation**: Tags dynamically presented as familiar folder structures\n    23→\n    24→### Processing Workflow\n    25→1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)\n    26→2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly\n    27→3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review\n    28→4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples\n    29→\n    30→## Tag System Design\n    31→\n    32→### Category Structure\n    33→- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n    34→- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\", \"Contract\")\n    35→- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability\n    36→\n    37→### Tag Management\n    38→- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options\n    39→- **Add/Delete Operations**: \n    40→  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents\n    41→  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files\n    42→- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options\n    43→\n    44→### AI Processing Approach\n    45→- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n    46→- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n    47→- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints\n    48→- **Two-Pass Algorithm**:\n    49→  1. **High Confidence Pass**: >90% confidence files categorized immediately\n    50→  2. **Context-Enhanced Pass**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized examples\n    51→\n    52→## User Interface Design\n    53→\n    54→### Flat View (Default)\n    55→- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags\n    56→- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping\n    57→- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n    58→\n    59→### Virtual Folder View\n    60→- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n    61→- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n    62→- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n    63→- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n    64→\n    65→### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n    66→- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n    67→- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n    68→- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n    69→\n    70→## Human Review System\n    71→\n    72→### Uncertainty Handling\n    73→- **Review Folder**: \"Human Review Required\" category for uncertain classifications\n    74→- **Confidence Thresholds**: User-adjustable sensitivity settings\n    75→- **Review Interface**: \n    76→  - Top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n    77→  - \"Other\" option for complete misclassification\n    78→  - \"Create New Category\" for expanding taxonomy\n    79→\n    80→### Learning Approach\n    81→- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n    82→- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future medium-confidence decisions\n    83→- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n    84→\n    85→## BATES Numbering System\n    86→\n    87→### Legal Workflow Integration\n    88→- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n    89→- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n    90→- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n    91→  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n    92→\n    93→### Numbering Rules\n    94→- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n    95→- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n    96→- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n    97→- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n    98→- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n    99→\n   100→### Deduplication Integration\n   101→- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n   102→- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n   103→\n   104→## Technical Implementation Approach\n   105→\n   106→### AI Integration\n   107→- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n   108→- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n   109→- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n   110→\n   111→### Data Storage\n   112→- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n   113→- **Metadata Storage**: Firestore documents track tags, categories, processing history, BATES assignments\n   114→- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n   115→\n   116→### Performance Considerations\n   117→- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n   118→- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n   119→- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n   120→\n   121→## User Stories\n   122→\n   123→### Document Discovery Stories\n   124→\n   125→**As a lawyer, I want to find bank

Ideas\\Organizer-Feature-Reference.md","content":"# Organizer Feature Reference Document\n\n## Overview\n\nThe **Organizer** is an AI-powered document discovery and organization system designed to help users find previously uploaded files through intelligent categorization and flexible viewing interfaces. Rather than traditional folder storage, it uses a tag-based flat storage system with virtual folder presentations optimized for legal document management workflows.\n\n## Core Purpose\n\n**Primary Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.\n\n**Target Use Cases**:\n- Finding bank statements by institution and account details\n- Locating photographs by location and date\n- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)\n- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Storage Strategy\n- **Flat File Storage**: All files stored in single Firebase Storage folder\n- **Tag-Based Organization**: Organization achieved through metadata tags, not physical folders\n- **Virtual Folder Presentation**: Tags dynamically presented as familiar folder structures\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)\n2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly\n3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review\n4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples\n\n## Tag System Design\n\n### Category Structure\n- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\", \"Contract\")\n- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability\n\n### Tag Management\n- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options\n- **Add/Delete Operations**: \n  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents\n  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files\n- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options\n\n### AI Processing Approach\n- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints\n- **Two-Pass Algorithm**:\n  1. **High Confidence Pass**: >90% confidence files categorized immediately\n  2. **Context-Enhanced Pass**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized examples\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Flat View (Default)\n- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags\n- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n\n### Virtual Folder View\n- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n\n### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n\n## Human Review System\n\n### Uncertainty Handling\n- **Review Folder**: \"Human Review Required\" category for uncertain classifications\n- **Confidence Thresholds**: User-adjustable sensitivity settings\n- **Review Interface**: \n  - Top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n  - \"Other\" option for complete misclassification\n  - \"Create New Category\" for expanding taxonomy\n\n### Learning Approach\n- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future medium-confidence decisions\n- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n\n## BATES Numbering System\n\n### Legal Workflow Integration\n- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n\n### Numbering Rules\n- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n\n### Deduplication Integration\n- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n\n## Technical Implementation Approach\n\n### AI Integration\n- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n\n### Data Storage\n- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n- **Metadata Storage**: Firestore documents track tags, categories, processing history, BATES assignments\n- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n\n## User Stories\n\n### Document Discovery Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to find bank statements by institution and account details**\n- Given I have uploaded hundreds of financial documents\n- When I need to find Royal Bank of Canada statements for account ending in 334\n- Then I can use tags to filter by \"Institution: RBC\" and \"Account: ...334\"\n- So that I can quickly locate the specific statements without manually searching through files\n\n**As a legal professional, I want to locate photographs by location and date**\n- Given I have uploaded many photographs as evidence\n- When I need to find photos taken at Whistler Mountain in June 2017\n- Then I can filter by \"Location: Whistler Mountain\" and \"Date: June 2017\" tags\n- So that I can present the relevant photographic evidence\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to track document relationships and follow-ups**\n- Given I sent a letter requesting information and never received a response\n- When I need to follow up on unanswered correspondence\n- Then I can search for my original letter and check for any response documents\n- So that I can determine how long the request has been pending and take appropriate action\n\n**As a legal professional, I want to find all amendments to a contract**\n- Given I have a promissory note with multiple amendments\n- When I need to review all versions and modifications\n- Then I can find the original document and all related amendment documents\n- So that I have a complete view of the document's evolution\n\n### Category Management Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to create custom document categories**\n- Given I have unique document types specific to my practice\n- When I create a new \"Document Type\" category\n- Then I can define custom tags like \"Affidavit\", \"Motion\", \"Brief\"\n- So that my organization system matches my specific workflow needs\n\n**As a user, I want to add new tag options to existing categories**\n- Given I encounter a new type of document not in my current system\n- When I add a \"Receipt\" tag to my \"Document Type\" category\n- Then the system asks if I want to reprocess existing documents\n- So that previously uploaded receipts can be properly categorized\n\n**As a user, I want to merge duplicate category options**\n- Given I created both \"Invoice\" and \"Bill\" tags but realize they're the same\n- When I delete the \"Bill\" tag and choose to reprocess affected documents\n- Then all documents previously tagged as \"Bill\" are reconsidered for \"Invoice\"\n- So that I can consolidate my categorization scheme without losing data\n\n### AI Processing Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to process documents in batches by category type**\n- Given I have uploaded a folder of mixed financial documents\n- When I select the folder and choose \"Document Type\" processing\n- Then the AI categorizes documents as statements, invoices, receipts, etc.\n- So that I can organize large batches efficiently without manual sorting\n\n**As a user, I want to review uncertain AI classifications**\n- Given the AI is less than 90% confident about some document categorizations\n- When I access the \"Human Review Required\" folder\n- Then I see the top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n- So that I can quickly correct misclassifications and improve system accuracy\n\n**As a user, I want the system to learn from my corrections**\n- Given I have manually classified several uncertain documents\n- When the AI processes similar documents with medium confidence\n- Then it uses my previous classifications as context examples\n- So that the system becomes more accurate for my specific document types\n\n### Interface Navigation Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to start with a comprehensive flat view**\n- Given I have many documents with various tags\n- When I first access the organizer\n- Then I see all files with color-coded tags by category\n- So that I can understand my entire document collection at a glance\n\n**As a user, I want to create folder views by clicking on tags**\n- Given I see documents with various \"Document Type\" tags in flat view\n- When I right-click on a \"Statement\" tag and select \"Show in Folders\"\n- Then my view reorganizes into folders by document type\n- So that I can browse documents in a familiar folder structure\n\n**As a user, I want to drill down through multiple folder levels**\n- Given I have organized by \"Document Type\" and want to sub-organize by date\n- When I right-click on a \"2023\" tag and select \"Show in Folders\"\n- Then I get a hierarchy like \"Statement > 2023 > March\"\n- So that I can narrow down to very specific document sets\n\n**As a user, I want to instantly reorganize my folder hierarchy**\n- Given I have documents organized by Type > Date\n- When I decide I want them organized by Date > Type instead\n- Then the reorganization happens instantly without processing delays\n- So that I can experiment with different organizational schemes efficiently\n\n### BATES Numbering Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to print documents with BATES stamps for disclosure**\n- Given I need to provide document disclosure for trial\n- When I print any document from the organizer\n- Then it includes a BATES number like \"Roberts-0001\" \n- So that I can track disclosed documents and prevent disclosure confusion\n\n**As a legal professional, I want consistent BATES numbering per matter**\n- Given I'm working on multiple legal matters\n- When I set different prefixes for each case (e.g., \"Smith-\", \"Jones-\")\n- Then each case maintains its own sequential numbering\n- So that documents are properly organized by matter\n\n**As a lawyer, I want permanent BATES number assignment**\n- Given I've printed a document with BATES number \"Roberts-0001\"\n- When I print the same document again later\n- Then it always prints with the same BATES number\n- So that I maintain consistency in legal proceedings\n\n**As a user, I want protection against BATES numbering mistakes**\n- Given I need to restart my BATES numbering due to an error\n- When I create a new prefix for the same matter\n- Then the old prefix is permanently retired and cannot be reused\n- So that there's no confusion about which numbering sequence is current\n\n### Human Review Interface Stories\n\n**As a user, I want simple review options for uncertain documents**\n- Given the AI presents a document with uncertain classification\n- When I see the 3 AI suggestions plus \"Other\" and \"Create New Category\" buttons\n- Then I can quickly select the correct option or create a new one\n- So that document review is fast and doesn't interrupt my workflow\n\n**As a user, I want to create new categories during review**\n- Given I encounter a document type not in my current system\n- When I click \"Create New Category\" during human review\n- Then the system asks if I want to reprocess other documents for this new category\n- So that I can expand my taxonomy as I discover new document types\n\n### Legal Workflow Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to prevent raw document downloads**\n- Given clients or opposing parties might create confusion with untracked copies\n- When I access any document in the organizer\n- Then I can only print BATES-stamped versions, not download raw files\n- So that all document copies in circulation are properly tracked and identified\n\n**As a legal professional, I want to track document processing history**\n- Given I need to verify whether documents have been properly processed\n- When I review any document's metadata\n- Then I can see whether it was classified by AI or human review\n- So that I can ensure quality control in my document management process\n\n## User Experience Flow\n\n### Initial Setup\n1. User uploads documents through existing upload feature\n2. Documents appear in flat view with basic metadata\n3. User creates categories and defines tag options\n4. User selects document batches for AI processing\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. User selects folder/batch and processing category\n2. AI processes documents with confidence-based routing\n3.

Header with search/filter bar\n- Main content area with file list table\n- Each row shows: filename, file type icon, upload date, tags, actions\n- Tag display as small chips/badges\n- Inline tag editing capability\n\n### Vuetify Components\n- `v-data-table` or `v-list` for file listing\n- `v-chip` for tag display\n- `v-text-field` for search and tag input\n- `v-icon` for file type indicators\n- `v-card` for overall layout container\n\n## Data Flow\n\n1. **File Loading**: Organizer store fetches file metadata from Firestore on mount\n2. **Tag Assignment**: User clicks tag input → opens inline editor → saves to Firestore → updates local state\n3. **Filtering**: User types in search → store computes filtered results → UI updates reactively\n4. **Tag Management**: Add/remove tags → optimistic UI update → Firestore write → error handling\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Store actions and getters\n- Component prop handling and events\n- Tag input validation and formatting\n- Filter logic correctness\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Firestore data operations\n- Authentication integration\n- Route navigation and guards\n- Cross-component data flow\n\n### E2E Tests\n- Complete organizer workflow\n- Tag assignment and search\n- Integration with existing upload system\n- Performance with multiple files\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Initial Implementation\n- Simple approach suitable for moderate file collections (100-1000 files)\n- Client-side filtering for responsive UI\n- Basic loading states during data fetch\n\n### Future Optimization Points\n- Virtual scrolling for large collections (planned for v1.9)\n- Server-side filtering for very large datasets\n- Lazy loading of file metadata\n- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data\n\n## Security Requirements\n\n### Firestore Rules\n```javascript\n// Ensure users can only access their own team's files\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /fileMetadata/{fileId} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth != null \n        && resource.data.teamId == request.auth.uid;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Data Validation\n- Sanitize tag input to prevent XSS\n- Validate file access permissions\n- Ensure team isolation in all operations\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Existing Systems\n- **Upload System**: Leverage existing file metadata and hash-based deduplication\n- **Authentication**: Use existing team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- **Storage**: Connect to existing Firebase Storage for file access\n- **Routing**: Integrate with existing Vue Router and navigation\n\n### Future Versions\n- Tag structure extensible to category-based system (v1.1)\n- Component architecture supports AI integration (v1.3)\n- Data model compatible with confidence scoring (v1.4)\n- UI framework supports virtual folder views (v1.2)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### Functional Requirements\n- [ ] Users can view all uploaded files in organized list\n- [ ] Users can assign text-based tags to any file\n- [ ] Users can search/filter files by tag text\n- [ ] System maintains existing upload functionality\n- [ ] All operations respect team-based data isolation\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- [ ] File list loads within 2 seconds for 100 files\n- [ ] Tag filtering responds within 500ms\n- [ ] Tag assignment saves within 1 second\n- [ ] UI remains responsive during all operations\n\n### User Experience Requirements\n- [ ] Intuitive interface requiring minimal learning\n- [ ] Consistent with existing application design patterns\n- [ ] Clear visual feedback for all user actions\n- [ ] Graceful error handling and recovery\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Technical Risks\n- **Large File Collections**: Start with client-side filtering, monitor performance\n- **Concurrent Tag Updates**: Implement optimistic updates with rollback capability\n- **Firestore Costs**: Monitor query patterns and implement pagination if needed\n\n### User Experience Risks\n- **Feature Discoverability**: Clear navigation and introductory help text\n- **Tag Management Complexity**: Keep v1.0 simple, defer advanced features to later versions\n- **Data Migration**: Ensure existing uploaded files are properly indexed\n\n## Documentation Requirements\n\n### Developer Documentation\n- Component API documentation\n- Store structure and actions\n- Data model and relationships\n- Testing guidelines and examples\n\n### User Documentation\n- Feature introduction and benefits\n- Step-by-step usage guide\n- Tag best practices\n- Integration with existing workflow\n\n## Deployment Strategy\n\n### Development Phases\n1. **Local Development**: Build and test all components in isolation\n2. **Integration Testing**: Test with existing system on development Firebase\n3. **User Acceptance Testing**: Deploy to staging environment for feedback\n4. **Production Deployment**: Roll out with feature flag capability\n\n### Rollback Plan\n- Feature toggle for organizer navigation item\n- Database schema changes are additive only\n- Component lazy loading allows graceful fallback\n- Separate service worker for organizer-specific functionality\n\n## Timeline Estimation\n\n### Week 1: Foundation\n- Data model design and Firestore setup\n- Basic component

**Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n\n### Virtual Folder View\n- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n\n### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n\n## Human Review System\n\n### Uncertainty Handling\n- **Review Folder**: \"Human Review Required\" category for uncertain classifications\n- **Confidence Thresholds**: User-adjustable sensitivity settings\n- **Review Interface**: \n  - Top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n  - \"Other\" option for complete misclassification\n  - \"Create New Category\" for expanding taxonomy\n\n### Learning Approach\n- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future medium-confidence decisions\n- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n\n## BATES Numbering System\n\n### Legal Workflow Integration\n- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n\n### Numbering Rules\n- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n\n### Deduplication Integration\n- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n\n## Technical Implementation Approach\n\n### AI Integration\n- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n\n### Data Storage\n- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n- **Metadata Storage**: Firestore documents track tags, categories, processing history, BATES assignments\n- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n\n## User Stories\n\n### Document Discovery Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to find bank statements by institution and account details**\n- Given I have uploaded hundreds of financial documents\n- When I need to find Royal Bank of Canada statements for account ending in 334\n- Then I can use tags to filter by \"Institution: RBC\" and \"Account: ...334\"\n- So that I can

encounter a new type of document not in my current system\n- When I add a \"Receipt\" tag to my \"Document Type\" category\n- Then the system asks if I want to reprocess existing documents\n- So that previously uploaded receipts can be properly categorized\n\n**As a user, I want to merge duplicate category options**\n- Given I created both \"Invoice\" and \"Bill\" tags but realize they're the same\n- When I delete the \"Bill\" tag and choose to reprocess affected documents\n- Then all documents previously tagged as \"Bill\" are reconsidered for \"Invoice\"\n- So that I can consolidate my categorization scheme without losing data\n\n### AI Processing Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to process documents in batches by category type**\n- Given I have uploaded a folder of mixed financial documents\n- When I select the folder and choose \"Document Type\" processing\n- Then the AI categorizes documents as statements, invoices, receipts, etc.\n- So that I can organize large batches efficiently without manual sorting\n\n**As a user, I want to review uncertain AI classifications**\n- Given the AI is less than 90% confident about some document categorizations\n- When I access the \"Human Review Required\" folder\n- Then I see the top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n- So that I can quickly correct misclassifications and improve system accuracy\n\n**As a user, I want the system to learn from my corrections**\n- Given I have manually classified several uncertain documents\n- When the AI processes similar documents with medium confidence\n- Then it uses my previous classifications as context examples\n- So that the system becomes more accurate for my specific document types\n\n### Interface Navigation Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to start with a comprehensive flat view**\n- Given I have many documents with various tags\n- When I first access the organizer\n- Then I see all files with color-coded tags by category\n- So that I can understand my

right-click on a \"Statement\" tag and select \"Show in Folders\"\n- Then my view reorganizes into folders by document type\n- So that I can browse documents in a familiar folder structure\n\n**As a user, I want to drill down through multiple folder levels**\n- Given I have organized by \"Document Type\" and want to sub-organize by date\n- When I right-click on a \"2023\" tag and select \"Show in Folders\"\n- Then I get a hierarchy like \"Statement > 2023 > March\"\n- So that I can narrow down to very specific document sets\n\n**As a user, I want to instantly reorganize my folder hierarchy**\n- Given I have documents organized by Type > Date\n- When I decide I want them organized by Date > Type instead\n- Then the reorganization happens instantly without processing delays\n- So that I can experiment with different organizational schemes efficiently\n\n### BATES Numbering Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to print documents with BATES stamps for disclosure**\n- Given I need to provide document disclosure for trial\n- When I print any document from the organizer\n- Then it includes a BATES number like \"Roberts-0001\" \n- So that I can track disclosed documents and prevent disclosure confusion\n\n**As a legal professional, I want consistent BATES numbering per matter**\n- Given I'm working on multiple legal matters\n- When I set different prefixes for each case (e.g., \"Smith-\", \"Jones-\")\n- Then each case maintains its own sequential numbering\n- So that documents are properly organized by matter\n\n**As a lawyer, I want permanent BATES number assignment**\n- Given I've printed a document with BATES number \"Roberts-0001\"\n- When I print the same document again later\n- Then it always prints with the same BATES number\n- So that I maintain consistency in legal proceedings\n\n**As a user, I want protection against BATES numbering mistakes**\n- Given I need to restart my BATES numbering due to an error\n- When I create a new prefix for the same matter\n- Then the old prefix is permanently retired and cannot be reused\n- So that there's no confusion about which numbering sequence is current\n\n### Human Review Interface Stories\n\n**As a user, I want simple review options for uncertain documents**\n- Given the AI presents a document with uncertain classification\n- When I see the 3 AI suggestions plus \"Other\" and \"Create New Category\" buttons\n- Then I can quickly select the correct option or create a new one\n- So that document review is fast and doesn't interrupt my workflow\n\n**As a user, I want to create new categories during review**\n- Given I encounter a document type not in my current system\n- When I click \"Create New Category\" during human review\n- Then the system asks if I want to reprocess other documents for this new category\n- So that I can expand my taxonomy as I discover new document types\n\n### Legal Workflow Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to prevent raw document downloads**\n- Given clients or opposing parties might create confusion with untracked copies\n- When I access any document in the organizer\n- Then I can only print BATES-stamped versions, not download raw files\n- So that all document copies in circulation are properly tracked and identified\n\n**As a legal professional, I want to track document processing history**\n- Given I need to verify whether documents have been properly processed\n- When I review any document's metadata\n- Then I can see whether it was classified by AI or human review\n- So that I can ensure quality control in my document management process\n\n## User Experience Flow\n\n### Initial Setup\n1.

Key Files Lines of Code Validation ❌\n\nThe plan lists key files to be created but fails to:\n- Verify that existing key files are accurately measured for lines of code \n- Account for the existing organizer skeleton files that already exist in `src/features/organizer/`\n\n### 2. Internet Research for High Complexity Steps ❌  \n\nThe plan identifies several steps as high complexity but fails to include internet research summaries for proven solutions:\n- Step 1: Data Layer Setup (High complexity) - No research on Firestore collection patterns\n- Step 3: Tag Management System (High complexity) - No research on tag input UI patterns  \n- Step 6: Integration with Existing System (High complexity) - No research on Firebase Storage integration patterns\n\n### 3. Breaking Risk Assessment and Rollback Mechanisms ❌\n\nWhile the plan mentions some risks in the \"Risk Mitigation\" section, it fails to:\n- Assign specific breaking risk levels (Low, Medium, High) to each step\n- Provide rollback mechanisms for medium/high risk steps\n- Address the breaking risk of modifying existing upload system data models\n\n### 4. Context Management Issues ❌\n\nThe plan fails to account for the existing organizer skeleton files found in the codebase at `src/features/organizer/`. The existing `FileListItem.vue` is only 16 lines but the plan should acknowledge these existing files rather than treating them as new creations.\n\n## Additional Mandatory Requirement Violations\n\n### 5. Executive Summary Problem Statement ❌\nThe plan lacks a clear problem statement. While it mentions the \"core goal,\" it doesn't articulate the specific user problem being solved in business terms.\n\n### 6. Step Dependencies and Logical Sequence ⚠️\nSome steps may have dependency issues:\n- Step 5 (Navigation and Routing) could potentially be done earlier to enable testing\n- Step 6 (Integration) appears to depend on completion of Steps 1-4 but this isn't explicitly stated\n\n## Standards That Need Attention\n\n### Single Source of Truth Violation\nThe plan proposes creating a new data model that might duplicate existing file metadata from the upload system. This needs clarification on how it integrates without creating multiple sources of truth.\n\n### YAGNI Compliance Issues  \nThe plan includes several features that go beyond Version 1.0 scope as defined in OrganizerVersions.md:\n- Performance optimization discussions premature for v1.0\n- Advanced UI patterns not needed for basic listing\n\n## Recommendations for Plan Revision\n\n**For each step where research is required, you should perform the research, and consider whether the entire implementation plan should be revamped.

All documents must be stored in collections.\n\n## File Metadata Organization Best Practices\n\n### Document Structure\nDocuments are limited in size to 1 MB, so for file metadata organization:\n\n- To dodge large documents, you can use subcollections or references for nested or related data. For instance, if a document contains a comment array, move the comments to a subcollection or store them in a separate collection with references to the original document.\n- Another technique is to compress or encode data, like images or videos, using gzip or base64 encoding before saving them in Firestore. This saves storage space and bandwidth.\n\n### Metadata Collections Pattern\nThere may also be situations where you want to store metadata about each collection. A unique collection that keeps track of unique values for a field would be a meta collection. If you wish to store totals, like the total number of items in a collection, you could use the _counters collection, where a document would be the collection's name. If you want to store data about your app in general, you could use a _meta collection and a good name like \"statistics\" for the document ID, depending on your data. I personally like to use an _ underscore to differentiate between normal collections and meta collections.\n\n## Document ID Best Practices\n\nAvoid the document IDs . and ... Avoid using / forward slashes in document IDs. Do not use monotonically increasing document IDs such as: Customer1, Customer2, Customer3, ...(no content)Such sequential IDs can lead to hotspots that impact latency.\n\n## Data Structure Guidelines\n\n### Hierarchical Organization\nSubcollections allow you to structure data hierarchically, making data easier to access. To get all messages in roomA, you can create a collection reference to the subcollection messages and interact with it like you would any other collection reference.(no content)You can nest data up to 100 levels deep.\n\n### Field Organization\nKeep maps and arrays one level deep, or filtering will be impossible. Multiple nested layers are ok when you are aggregating data.\n\n## Performance and Scaling Patterns\n\n### Traffic Ramping\nWe recommend starting with a maximum of 500 operations per second to a new collection and then increasing traffic by 50% every 5 minutes. This is called the \"500/50/5\" rule.\n\n### Denormalization and Aggregation\nFirestore's NoSQL database allows for flexible and dynamic data models but it doesn't support complex queries like joins, group bys, or aggregations. For instance, you can store monthly revenue in a separate collection instead of summing up all orders each time, reducing reads and enhancing query performance.(no content)Denormalization and aggregation techniques can boost query performance and reduce read operations but they may also increase storage costs, write operations, and complexity in your data model and code logic. Strive for a balance between normalization and denormalization when designing your data structure.\n\n## 2024 Performance Considerations\n\nIn this article, we will cover points ranging from using indexes wisely and avoiding large collections and documents to using denormalization and aggregation techniques and using batch operations and transactions wisely. By following the best practices we present here, you'll maximize Firestore's potential while ensuring a swift and reliable user experience for your app.\n\nThese patterns provide a comprehensive framework for organizing file metadata and documents in Firestore while maintaining optimal performance and scalability."}]},"uuid":"108887f1-2263-4be2-9963-3b72f8b4db93","timestamp":"2025-08-29T14:52:59.415Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Firestore collection patterns file metadata document organization best practices 2024","results":["I'll search for the latest best practices on organizing Firestore collections with file metadata and document patterns.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01NVipentAm7mXYE6LJxRkAA","content":[{"title":"Best practices for Cloud Firestore | Firebase","url":"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/best-practices"},{"title":"Cloud Firestore Data model | Firebase","url":"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model"},{"title":"Understanding Firestore Collections - Code.Build 💻","url":"https://code.build/p/understanding-firestore-collections-SblJoq"},{"title":"Choose a data structure | Firestore | Firebase","url":"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/structure-data"},{"title":"Best practices | Firestore in Native mode | Google Cloud","url":"https://cloud.google.com/firestore/native/docs/best-practices"},{"title":"7+ Google Firestore Query Performance Best Practices for 2024 | Estuary","url":"https://estuary.dev/blog/firestore-query-best-practices/"},{"title":"Cloud Firestore | FlutterFire","url":"https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/firestore/usage/"},{"title":"Cloud Firestore | React Native Firebase","url":"https://rnfirebase.io/firestore/usage"},{"title":"Understand reads and writes at scale | Firestore | Firebase","url":"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/understand-reads-writes-scale"},{"title":"What is the best practice of firestore data structure?","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48651369/what-is-the-best-practice-of-firestore-data-structure"}]},"Based on my search results, here are the key Firestore collection patterns and best practices for file metadata and document organization in 2024:\n\n## Collection Naming and Structure Patterns\n\nUse lowerCamelCase in field names and the plural case for collection names.(no content)Cloud Firestore is optimized for storing large collections of small documents.

It's used this way in the CommandPalette, InputMenu, Select or SelectMenu components for example\n\n## Building Custom Tag Input Components\n\n**Vue School Tutorial Approach**: In this article we'll use Vue 3's composition API to make a reusable tag input component of our very own... The tag input allows you to type in custom tags and then commit them to the input when the enter key is pressed. The input will also support limiting the tags to only certain values that will display on focus and be filtered down as the user types. Best of all, these features will be built so that the component is reusable and has an intuitive interface that works much like a normal input element.\n\n**Implementation Pattern**: We can just use an unordered list in which we'll loop over the tags. Then, later on we can use some custom styling and a little javascript to get things positioned over the input as you'd expect them to be.\n\n## Vue 3 Composition API Best Practices (2024)\n\n**Component Design Patterns:**\n- **Branching Components**: Extract complex conditional rendering into separate components. Instead of multiple v-if branches in one component, create dedicated components for each state. The resulting code is easier to read and maintain over time\n- **List/Item Separation**: Separate list logic and item display into distinct components. This allows for bundling up list empty state, content, controls, and more into a contained List component. Extracting each item in the list to it's own ListItem component, makes the List component easy to read, and provides more focus when developing and styling each item\n\n**Composable Functions:**\n- **Reusability**: The Composition API makes it easy to extract and reuse component logic via composable functions, allowing you to share functionality between different components more efficiently\n- **DRY Principle**: This allows you to create composable functions that encapsulate specific functionality. These composables can then be imported and reused across different components, promoting the \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (DRY) principle\n\n## Accessibility Considerations\n\n**PrimeVue Accessibility**: Value to describe the component can either be provided via label tag combined with inputId prop or using aria-labelledby, aria-label props. Chip list uses listbox role with aria-orientation set to horizontal whereas each chip has the option role with aria-label set to the label of the chip.\n\n## General Vue 3 Best Practices (2024)\n\n- **Consistency**: But to create some sort of convention across your project, you should either always use them or never use them. This will make your project more cohesive and readable\n- **State Initialization**: So I suggest initializing the value of your products with ref(null). If you do so you may show if the request is loading or the request is finished and there are no results. This mode solves the collision of products being empty and requests failing while the initial value of an empty array is preserved\n\nThe search reveals that for 2024, the trend is toward using established UI libraries like PrimeVue, Vuetify, or Shadcn/Vue for production applications, while custom implementations should leverage Vue 3's Composition API with proper composable patterns for reusability and maintainability."}]},"uuid":"e5d12e45-af94-475e-82b0-781ed1128f18","timestamp":"2025-08-29T14:53:41.354Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Vue 3 tag input component UI patterns chip input best practices 2024","results":["I'll search for Vue 3 tag input component UI patterns and best practices for you.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01M1ao32at9r6HLyXAyxut64","content":[{"title":"PrimeVue | Vue UI Component Library","url":"https://v3.primevue.org/chips/"},{"title":"Chip component — Vuetify","url":"https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/chips/"},{"title":"Building a Tag Input Component with the Vue 3 Composition API - Vue School Articles","url":"https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/building-a-tag-input-component-with-the-vue-3-composition-api/"},{"title":"Tags Input - shadcn/vue","url":"https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/tags-input"},{"title":"5 Component Design Patterns to Boost Your Vue.js Applications - Vue School Articles","url":"https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/5-component-design-patterns-to-boost-your-vue-js-applications/"},{"title":"Design Patterns and best practices with the Composition API in Vue 3 | by David May | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@davisaac8/design-patterns-and-best-practices-with-the-composition-api-in-vue-3-77ba95cb4d63"},{"title":"Vue 3 Best Practices, Write a Better Code - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/adnanbabakan/vue-3-best-practices-write-a-better-code-2abc"},{"title":"Vue Best Practices | LearnVue","url":"https://learnvue.co/articles/vue-best-practices"},{"title":"PrimeVue | Vue UI Component Library","url":"https://primevue.org/chip/"},{"title":"Vue Chip Component - Nuxt UI","url":"https://ui.nuxt.com/components/chip"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about Vue 3 tag input component UI patterns, chip inputs, and best practices for 2024:\n\n## Vue 3 Tag Input Component Libraries & Solutions\n\n**Popular UI Libraries with Tag/Chip Input Components:**\n- **PrimeVue**: Chips is used to enter multiple values on an input field\n- **Vuetify**: The chip component allows a user to enter information, make selections, filter content or trigger actions\n- **Shadcn/Vue**: Tag inputs render tags inside an input, followed by an actual text input\n- **Nuxt UI**: An indicator of a numeric value or a state...

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Firebase Storage Integration with Vue 3\n\n### VueFire - The Official Solution\nVueFire provides official Firebase bindings for Vue.js. You don't need to install anything specific to use Firebase Storage with VueFire. Just import the different composables you need from vuefire and you're good to go.\n\n### Key Composables for File Management\n\n**1. useStorageFile() Composable**\nYou can upload and monitor the progress of a file upload with the useStorageFile() composable. This also exposes the URL of the file once it's uploaded and its metadata.\n\n**2. useStorageFileUrl() Composable**\nVueFire also exposes a smaller composable that only retrieves the url of a file.\n\n**3. useStorageFileMetadata() Composable**\nYou can access file metadata using the useStorageFileMetadata() composable, which provides metadata, refresh functionality, and update capabilities.\n\n### File Metadata Sync Patterns\n\n**Reactive Metadata Management**\nYou can use the update() function to update the metadata and keep the reactive variable up to date. The metadata is accessible on the useStorageFile() composable as well.\n\n**Core Metadata Properties**\nFiles can store custom key/value pairs with additional file metadata. File metadata contains common properties such as name, size, and contentType (often referred to as MIME type) in addition to some less common ones like contentDisposition and timeCreated.\n\n### 2024 Implementation Patterns\n\n**Composition API Approach**\nRecent tutorials show building a useFileUpload Vue 3 Composable which uploads files to Firebase Cloud Storage using Typescript.\n\n**Upload with Progress Tracking**\nTo upload a file, use the uploadFileResumable function from firebase/storage. It returns an UploadTask which you can use to get the upload percentage, pause, resume, or even cancel uploading.\n\n### Code Example Pattern\nHere's the typical pattern for Vue 3 + Firebase Storage integration:\n\n```typescript\nimport { useFirebaseStorage, useStorageFile } from 'vuefire'\nimport { ref as storageRef } from 'firebase/storage'\n\nconst storage = useFirebaseStorage()\nconst fileRef = storageRef(storage, 'images/file.jpg')\n\nconst { \n  url, \n  metadata,\n  refresh,\n  update\n} = useStorageFile(fileRef)\n```\n\nThe search results indicate that VueFire has become the standard approach for Vue 3 Firebase integration in 2024, providing reactive bindings that automatically sync metadata changes and file status updates."}]},"uuid":"3c65e4a9-b461-4ea2-84c8-5fc6ccbb7add","timestamp":"2025-08-29T14:54:06.929Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Firebase Storage integration Vue 3 file metadata sync patterns 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_014htqQrix8yKaiZR48wpN31","content":[{"title":"Firebase Storage | VueFire","url":"https://vuefire.vuejs.org/guide/storage.html"},{"title":"Use file metadata with Cloud Storage on Web | Cloud Storage for Firebase","url":"https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/file-metadata"},{"title":"[Video] Using Vue 3 Beta with Ionic Firebase File Upload & Capacitor Plugins - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/aaronksaunders/video-using-vue-3-beta-with-ionic-firebase-file-upload-capacitor-plugins-9j8"},{"title":"How uploaded file on Firebase storage then store the url inside firestore with vue 3 (composition API)","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75925173/how-uploaded-file-on-firebase-storage-then-store-the-url-inside-firestore-with-v"},{"title":"Cloud Storage for Firebase","url":"https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage"},{"title":"Introduction | VueFire","url":"https://vuefire.vuejs.org/guide/"},{"title":"Upload Files to Firebase Cloud Storage using Vue 3, Typescript, and the Composition API | by Amenallah Hsoumi | RunThatLine | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/runthatline/uploading-files-to-firebase-cloud-storage-using-vue-3-and-the-composition-api-d8370d1c03f7"},{"title":"Vue Basics: How to Use Vue with Firebase","url":"https://www.telerik.com/blogs/vue-basics-how-use-vue-firebase"},{"title":"Get started with Cloud Storage on web | Cloud Storage for Firebase","url":"https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/start"},{"title":"How to build and deploy a Vue.js app with Cloud Firestore and Vuefire - LogRocket Blog","url":"https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-build-deploy-vue-js-app-with-cloud-firestore-vuefire/"}]},"Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Firebase Storage integration with Vue 3 and file metadata sync patterns.

└── FileFilter.vue\n├── stores/\n│   └── organizer.js\n├── services/\n│   └── organizerService.js\n└── composables/\n    └── useOrganizer.js\n```\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Layout Structure\n- Header with search/filter bar\n- Main content area with file list table\n- Each row shows: filename, file type icon, upload date, tags, actions\n- Tag display as small chips/badges\n- Inline tag editing capability\n\n### Vuetify Components\n- `v-data-table` or `v-list` for file listing\n- `v-chip` for tag display\n- `v-text-field` for search and tag input\n- `v-icon` for file type indicators\n- `v-card` for overall layout container\n\n## Data Flow\n\n1. **File Loading**: Organizer store fetches file metadata from Firestore on mount\n2. **Tag Assignment**: User clicks tag input → opens inline editor → saves to Firestore → updates local state\n3. **Filtering**: User types in search → store computes filtered results → UI updates reactively\n4. **Tag Management**: Add/remove tags → optimistic UI update → Firestore write → error handling\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Store actions and getters\n- Component prop handling and events\n- Tag input validation and formatting\n- Filter logic correctness\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Firestore data operations\n- Authentication integration\n- Route navigation and guards\n- Cross-component data flow\n\n### E2E Tests\n- Complete organizer workflow\n- Tag assignment and search\n- Integration with existing upload system\n- Performance with multiple files\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Initial Implementation\n- Simple approach suitable for moderate file collections (100-1000 files)\n- Client-side filtering for responsive UI\n- Basic loading states during data fetch\n\n### Future Optimization Points\n- Virtual scrolling for large collections (planned for v1.9)\n- Server-side filtering for very large datasets\n- Lazy loading of file metadata\n- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data\n\n## Security Requirements\n\n### Firestore Rules\n```javascript\n// Ensure users can only access their own team's files\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /fileMetadata/{fileId} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth != null \n        && resource.data.teamId == request.auth.uid;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Data Validation\n- Sanitize tag input to prevent XSS\n- Validate file access permissions\n- Ensure team isolation in all operations\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Existing Systems\n- **Upload System**: Leverage existing file metadata and hash-based deduplication\n- **Authentication**: Use existing team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- **Storage**: Connect to existing Firebase Storage for file access\n- **Routing**: Integrate with existing Vue Router and navigation\n\n### Future Versions\n- Tag structure extensible to category-based system (v1.1)\n- Component architecture supports AI integration (v1.3)\n- Data model compatible with confidence scoring (v1.4)\n- UI framework supports virtual folder views (v1.2)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### Functional Requirements\n- [ ] Users can view all uploaded files in organized list\n- [ ] Users can assign text-based tags to any file\n- [ ] Users can search/filter files by tag text\n- [ ] System maintains existing upload functionality\n- [ ] All operations respect team-based data isolation\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- [ ] File list loads within 2 seconds for 100 files\n- [ ] Tag filtering responds within 500ms\n- [ ] Tag assignment saves within 1 second\n- [ ] UI remains responsive during all operations\n\n### User Experience Requirements\n- [ ] Intuitive interface requiring minimal learning\n- [ ] Consistent with existing application design patterns\n- [ ] Clear visual feedback for all user actions\n- [ ] Graceful error handling and recovery\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Technical Risks\n- **Large File Collections**: Start with client-side filtering, monitor performance\n- **Concurrent Tag Updates**: Implement optimistic updates with rollback capability\n- **Firestore Costs**: Monitor query patterns and implement pagination if needed\n\n### User Experience Risks\n- **Feature Discoverability**: Clear navigation and introductory help text\n- **Tag Management Complexity**: Keep v1.0 simple, defer advanced features to later versions\n- **Data Migration**: Ensure existing uploaded files are properly indexed\n\n## Documentation Requirements\n\n### Developer Documentation\n- Component API documentation\n- Store structure and actions\n- Data model and relationships\n- Testing guidelines and examples\n\n### User Documentation\n- Feature introduction and benefits\n- Step-by-step usage guide\n- Tag best practices\n- Integration with existing workflow\n\n## Deployment Strategy\n\n### Development Phases\n1. **Local Development**: Build and test all components in isolation\n2. **Integration Testing**: Test with existing system on development Firebase\n3. **User Acceptance Testing**: Deploy to staging environment for feedback\n4. **Production Deployment**: Roll out with feature flag capability\n\n### Rollback Plan\n- Feature toggle for organizer navigation item\n- Database schema changes are additive only\n- Component lazy loading allows graceful fallback\n- Separate service worker for organizer-specific functionality\n\n## Timeline Estimation\n\n### Week 1: Foundation\n- Data model design and Firestore setup\n- Basic component structure\n- Store implementation and integration\n\n### Week 2: Core Features\n- File list display and tag input\n- Basic search/filter functionality\n- Navigation integration\n\n### Week 3: Polish

└── FileFilter.vue\n├── stores/\n│   └── organizer.js\n├── services/\n│   └── organizerService.js\n└── composables/\n    └── useOrganizer.js\n```\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Layout Structure\n- Header with search/filter bar\n- Main content area with file list table\n- Each row shows: filename, file type icon, upload date, tags, actions\n- Tag display as small chips/badges\n- Inline tag editing capability\n\n### Vuetify Components\n- `v-data-table` or `v-list` for file listing\n- `v-chip` for tag display\n- `v-text-field` for search and tag input\n- `v-icon` for file type indicators\n- `v-card` for overall layout container\n\n## Data Flow\n\n1. **File Loading**: Organizer store fetches file metadata from Firestore on mount\n2. **Tag Assignment**: User clicks tag input → opens inline editor → saves to Firestore → updates local state\n3. **Filtering**: User types in search → store computes filtered results → UI updates reactively\n4. **Tag Management**: Add/remove tags → optimistic UI update → Firestore write → error handling\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Store actions and getters\n- Component prop handling and events\n- Tag input validation and formatting\n- Filter logic correctness\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Firestore data operations\n- Authentication integration\n- Route navigation and guards\n- Cross-component data flow\n\n### E2E Tests\n- Complete organizer workflow\n- Tag assignment and search\n- Integration with existing upload system\n- Performance with multiple files\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Initial Implementation\n- Simple approach suitable for moderate file collections (100-1000 files)\n- Client-side filtering for responsive UI\n- Basic loading states during data fetch\n\n### Future Optimization Points\n- Virtual scrolling for large collections (planned for v1.9)\n- Server-side filtering for very large datasets\n- Lazy loading of file metadata\n- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data\n\n## Security Requirements\n\n### Firestore Rules\n```javascript\n// Ensure users can only access their own team's files\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /fileMetadata/{fileId} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth != null \n        && resource.data.teamId == request.auth.uid;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Data Validation\n- Sanitize tag input to prevent XSS\n- Validate file access permissions\n- Ensure team isolation in all operations\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Existing Systems\n- **Upload System**: Leverage existing file metadata and hash-based deduplication\n- **Authentication**: Use existing team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- **Storage**: Connect to existing Firebase Storage for file access\n- **Routing**: Integrate with existing Vue Router and navigation\n\n### Future Versions\n- Tag structure extensible to category-based system (v1.1)\n- Component architecture supports AI integration (v1.3)\n- Data model compatible with confidence scoring (v1.4)\n- UI framework supports virtual folder views (v1.2)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### Functional Requirements\n- [ ] Users can view all uploaded files in organized list\n- [ ] Users can assign text-based tags to any file\n- [ ] Users can search/filter files by tag text\n- [ ] System maintains existing upload functionality\n- [ ] All operations respect team-based data isolation\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- [ ] File list loads within 2 seconds for 100 files\n- [ ] Tag filtering responds within 500ms\n- [ ] Tag assignment saves within 1 second\n- [ ] UI remains responsive during all operations\n\n### User Experience Requirements\n- [ ] Intuitive interface requiring minimal learning\n- [ ] Consistent with existing application design patterns\n- [ ] Clear visual feedback for all user actions\n- [ ] Graceful error handling and recovery\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Technical Risks\n- **Large File Collections**: Start with client-side filtering, monitor performance\n- **Concurrent Tag Updates**: Implement optimistic updates with rollback capability\n- **Firestore Costs**: Monitor query patterns and implement pagination if needed\n\n### User Experience Risks\n- **Feature Discoverability**: Clear navigation and introductory help text\n- **Tag Management Complexity**: Keep v1.0 simple, defer advanced features to later versions\n- **Data Migration**: Ensure existing uploaded files are properly indexed\n\n## Documentation Requirements\n\n### Developer Documentation\n- Component API documentation\n- Store structure and actions\n- Data model and relationships\n- Testing guidelines and examples\n\n### User Documentation\n- Feature introduction and benefits\n- Step-by-step usage guide\n- Tag best practices\n- Integration with existing workflow\n\n## Deployment Strategy\n\n### Development Phases\n1. **Local Development**: Build and test all components in isolation\n2. **Integration Testing**: Test with existing system on development Firebase\n3. **User Acceptance Testing**: Deploy to staging environment for feedback\n4. **Production Deployment**: Roll out with feature flag capability\n\n### Rollback Plan\n- Feature toggle for organizer navigation item\n- Database schema changes are additive only\n- Component lazy loading allows graceful fallback\n- Separate service worker for organizer-specific functionality\n\n## Timeline Estimation\n\n### Week 1: Foundation\n- Data model design and Firestore setup\n- Basic component structure\n- Store implementation and integration\n\n### Week 2: Core Features\n- File list display and tag input\n- Basic search/filter functionality\n- Navigation integration\n\n### Week 3: Polish

Files exist only as an unstructured list from the upload system, making document discovery time-consuming and inefficient, particularly for legal professionals who need to quickly locate specific documents among hundreds or thousands of uploaded files.\n\n### Solution Overview\nImplement a basic file listing interface with manual tag assignment capability, providing users with fundamental document organization through text-based tags and simple search functionality.\n\n## Core Goal\n\nCreate a simple file list view with manual tag assignment capability, providing users with basic document organization through text-based tags.\n\n## Features to Implement\n\n### 1. Basic File List View\n- Display all uploaded files with metadata (filename, extension, upload date)\n- Integration with existing Firebase storage system\n- Simple table/list interface using Vuetify components\n\n### 2. Manual Tag Assignment\n- Tag input interface for each file (text-based input)\n- Tags stored as array of strings in Firestore\n- Ability to add/remove tags per file\n\n### 3. Basic Search/Filter\n- Text-based filtering by tag names\n- Simple search interface at top of file list\n- Real-time filtering as user types\n\n### 4. Navigation Integration\n- New \"Organizer\" route and navigation item\n- Proper Vue Router integration\n- Route guards for authenticated access\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Data Model\n```javascript\n// Firestore document structure for file metadata\n{\n  id: \"file-hash-id\", // Existing hash-based ID from upload system\n  teamId: \"user-team-id\", // Existing team isolation\n  filename: \"document.pdf\",\n  originalName: \"Original Document Name.pdf\",\n  fileExtension: \".pdf\",\n  uploadDate: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  tags: [\"invoice\", \"2024\", \"client-a\"], // New field for manual tags\n  createdAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  updatedAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"\n}\n```\n\n### Component Structure\n```\nviews/\n  Organizer.vue                 // Main organizer page\ncomponents/features/organizer/\n  FileList.vue                  // File list display component\n  FileListItem.vue              // Individual file row component\n  TagInput.vue                  // Tag input/management component\n  FileFilter.vue                // Search/filter interface\n```\n\n### Store Integration\n```javascript\n// New Pinia store for organizer functionality\nstores/organizer.js\n- fileList: [] // Array of file objects with tags\n- filteredFiles: [] // Computed filtered results\n- filterText: \"\" // Current filter string\n- actions: fetchFiles(), updateFileTags(), filterFiles()\n```\n\n## Existing Codebase Assessment\n\n### Current Organizer Files (Lines of Code)\n- `FileListItem.vue`: 16 lines (skeleton with TODO comments)\n- `FileSearch.vue`: 16 lines (skeleton with TODO comments)  \n- `useFileSearch.js`: 44 lines (partial implementation with basic search logic)\n- Additional skeleton files: `FileGrid.vue`, `FilePreview.vue`, `FileDetails.vue`, `ViewModeToggle.vue`, `FileTypeFilters.vue` (all basic skeletons)\n- Composables: `useFileViewer.js`, `useFilePreview.js`, `useViewerNavigation.js` (skeleton files)\n- Utils: `fileViewerUtils.js`, `previewGenerators.js` (skeleton files)\n\n**Total Existing**: ~15 skeleton files with approximately 200 lines of placeholder code\n\n### Integration Points\n- Existing upload system uses hash-based file identification\n- Firebase Storage already configured and working\n- Authentication system with team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- Vuetify components and styling system established\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Data Layer Setup (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium  \n**Dependencies**: None  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Based on Firebase documentation and 2024 best practices, optimal Firestore collection patterns recommend using lowerCamelCase field names, avoiding sequential document IDs to prevent hotspots, and implementing subcollections for hierarchical data. For file metadata, the recommendation is to denormalize data for query performance while keeping documents under 1MB. The pattern of using hash-based IDs (already implemented in upload system) aligns with best practices for avoiding monotonically increasing IDs that can cause latency issues.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: All data model changes are additive only. New `tags` field can be removed from existing documents without breaking upload functionality. Firestore security rules can be reverted to previous state if needed.\n\n- [ ] Create Firestore collection structure for file metadata\n- [ ] Implement data migration from existing upload system  \n- [ ] Create Pinia store for organizer state management\n- [ ] Add Firestore security rules for organizer data access\n\n### Step 2: Core Components (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1 (data layer)  \n\n- [ ] Enhance existing `Organizer.vue` view component  \n- [ ] Build `FileList.vue` component for displaying files\n- [ ] Complete implementation of existing `FileListItem.vue` skeleton (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Create `TagInput.vue` component for tag management\n\n### Step 3: Tag Management System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium\n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 2  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Vue 3 tag input best practices for 2024 recommend using established UI libraries (PrimeVue, Vuetify, Shadcn/Vue) for production applications. Vuetify's chip component provides built-in accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation. Custom implementations should leverage Composition API with composable patterns for reusability. The recommended pattern includes reactive tag arrays, input validation, and proper event handling for add/remove operations.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Tag functionality can be disabled via feature flag. Firestore writes for tags can be wrapped in try/catch with rollback to previous tag state on failure.\n\n- [ ] Implement tag input interface with add/remove functionality\n- [ ] Create tag display with visual indicators using Vuetify chips\n- [ ] Add tag persistence to Firestore\n- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates for tag changes\n\n### Step 4: Search and Filter (Low Complexity)  \n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low\n**Dependencies**: Step 2, Step 3  \n\n- [ ] Complete existing `FileSearch.vue` skeleton component (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Enhance existing `useFileSearch.js` composable (currently 44 lines with basic logic)\n- [ ] Implement real-time filtering logic in store\n- [ ] Add filter state management and persistence\n\n### Step 5: Navigation and Routing (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 2\n\n- [ ] Add \"Organizer\" route to Vue Router configuration\n- [ ] Update navigation sidebar with Organizer link  \n- [ ] Implement route guards for authentication\n- [ ] Add proper page titles and meta information\n\n### Step 6: Integration with Existing System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: High  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 5  \n**Internet Research Summary**: VueFire (official Vue.js Firebase bindings) provides the recommended 2024 approach for Firebase Storage integration with Vue 3. The `useStorageFile()`, `useStorageFileUrl()`, and `useStorageFileMetadata()` composables offer reactive bindings that automatically sync metadata changes. The pattern involves importing composables from VueFire and using reactive references for file operations, which aligns with our existing Firebase setup.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Integration changes can be isolated behind feature flags. Existing upload functionality remains unchanged. If metadata sync fails, system falls back to upload-only mode. Database queries can be reverted to original upload system patterns.\n\n- [ ] Connect to existing Firebase storage system using VueFire patterns\n- [ ] Leverage existing file upload metadata without breaking current functionality\n- [ ] Ensure team-based data isolation maintains existing security model\n- [ ] Test integration with existing authentication system\n\n### Step 7: Testing and Polish (Medium Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: All previous steps  \n\n- [ ] Write unit tests for new components  \n- [ ] Add E2E tests for organizer workflow\n- [ ] Test with large file collections\n- [ ] Performance optimization and loading states\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── views/\n│   └── Organizer.vue\n├── components/features/organizer/\n│   ├──

useOrganizer.js\n```\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Layout Structure\n- Header with search/filter bar\n- Main content area with file list table\n- Each row shows: filename, file type icon, upload date, tags, actions\n- Tag display as small chips/badges\n- Inline tag editing capability\n\n### Vuetify Components\n- `v-data-table` or `v-list` for file listing\n- `v-chip` for tag display\n- `v-text-field` for search and tag input\n- `v-icon` for file type indicators\n- `v-card` for overall layout container\n\n## Data Flow\n\n1. **File Loading**: Organizer store fetches file metadata from Firestore on mount\n2. **Tag Assignment**: User clicks tag input → opens inline editor → saves to Firestore → updates local state\n3. **Filtering**: User types in search → store computes filtered results → UI updates reactively\n4. **Tag Management**: Add/remove tags → optimistic UI update → Firestore write → error handling\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Store actions and getters\n- Component prop handling and events\n- Tag input validation and formatting\n- Filter logic correctness\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Firestore data operations\n- Authentication integration\n- Route navigation and guards\n- Cross-component data flow\n\n### E2E Tests\n- Complete organizer workflow\n- Tag assignment and search\n- Integration with existing upload system\n- Performance with multiple files\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Initial Implementation\n- Simple approach suitable for moderate file collections (100-1000 files)\n- Client-side filtering for responsive UI\n- Basic loading states during data fetch\n\n### Future Optimization Points\n- Virtual scrolling for large collections (planned for v1.9)\n- Server-side filtering for very large datasets\n- Lazy loading of file metadata\n- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data\n\n## Security Requirements\n\n### Firestore Rules\n```javascript\n// Ensure users can only access their own team's files\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /fileMetadata/{fileId} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth != null \n        && resource.data.teamId == request.auth.uid;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Data Validation\n- Sanitize tag input to prevent XSS\n- Validate file access permissions\n- Ensure team isolation in all operations\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Existing Systems\n- **Upload System**: Leverage existing file metadata and hash-based deduplication\n- **Authentication**: Use existing team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- **Storage**: Connect to existing Firebase Storage for file access\n- **Routing**: Integrate with existing Vue Router and navigation\n\n### Future Versions\n- Tag structure extensible to category-based system (v1.1)\n- Component architecture supports AI integration (v1.3)\n- Data model compatible with confidence scoring (v1.4)\n- UI framework supports virtual folder views (v1.2)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### Functional Requirements\n- [ ] Users can view all uploaded files in organized list\n- [ ] Users can assign text-based tags to any file\n- [ ] Users can search/filter files by tag text\n- [ ] System maintains existing upload functionality\n- [ ] All operations respect team-based data isolation\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- [ ] File list loads within 2 seconds for 100 files\n- [ ] Tag filtering responds within 500ms\n- [ ] Tag assignment saves within 1 second\n- [ ] UI remains responsive during all operations\n\n### User Experience Requirements\n- [ ] Intuitive interface requiring minimal learning\n- [ ] Consistent with existing application design patterns\n- [ ] Clear visual feedback for all user actions\n- [ ] Graceful error handling and recovery\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Technical Risks\n- **Large File Collections**: Start with client-side filtering, monitor performance\n- **Concurrent Tag Updates**: Implement optimistic updates with rollback capability\n- **Firestore Costs**: Monitor query patterns and implement pagination if needed\n\n### User Experience Risks\n- **Feature Discoverability**: Clear navigation and introductory help text\n- **Tag Management Complexity**: Keep v1.0 simple, defer advanced features to later versions\n- **Data Migration**: Ensure existing uploaded files are properly indexed\n\n## Documentation Requirements\n\n### Developer Documentation\n- Component API documentation\n- Store structure and actions\n- Data model and relationships\n- Testing guidelines and examples\n\n### User Documentation\n- Feature introduction and benefits\n- Step-by-step usage guide\n- Tag best practices\n- Integration with existing workflow\n\n## Deployment Strategy\n\n### Development Phases\n1. **Local Development**: Build and test all components in isolation\n2. **Integration Testing**: Test with existing system on development Firebase\n3. **User Acceptance Testing**: Deploy to staging environment for feedback\n4. **Production Deployment**: Roll out with feature flag capability\n\n### Rollback Plan\n- Feature toggle for organizer navigation item\n- Database schema changes are additive only\n- Component lazy loading allows graceful fallback\n- Separate service worker for organizer-specific functionality\n\n## Timeline Estimation\n\n### Week 1: Foundation\n- Data model design and Firestore setup\n- Basic component structure\n- Store implementation and integration\n\n### Week 2: Core Features\n- File list display and tag input\n- Basic search/filter functionality\n- Navigation integration\n\n### Week 3: Polish and Testing\n- UI refinement and responsive design\n- Comprehensive testing suite\n- Performance optimization and error handling\n\n###

Navigation Integration\n- New \"Organizer\" route and navigation item\n- Proper Vue Router integration\n- Route guards for authenticated access\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Data Model\n```javascript\n// Firestore document structure for file metadata\n{\n  id: \"file-hash-id\", // Existing hash-based ID from upload system\n  teamId: \"user-team-id\", // Existing team isolation\n  filename: \"document.pdf\",\n  originalName: \"Original Document Name.pdf\",\n  fileExtension: \".pdf\",\n  uploadDate: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  tags: [\"invoice\", \"2024\", \"client-a\"], // New field for manual tags\n  createdAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  updatedAt: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"\n}\n```\n\n### Component Structure\n```\nviews/\n  Organizer.vue                 // Main organizer page\ncomponents/features/organizer/\n  FileList.vue                  // File list display component\n  FileListItem.vue              // Individual file row component\n  TagInput.vue                  // Tag input/management component\n  FileFilter.vue                // Search/filter interface\n```\n\n### Store Integration\n```javascript\n// New Pinia store for organizer functionality\nstores/organizer.js\n- fileList: [] // Array of file objects with tags\n- filteredFiles: [] // Computed filtered results\n- filterText: \"\" // Current filter string\n- actions: fetchFiles(), updateFileTags(), filterFiles()\n```\n\n## Existing Codebase Assessment\n\n### Current Organizer Files (Lines of Code)\n- `FileListItem.vue`: 16 lines (skeleton with TODO comments)\n- `FileSearch.vue`: 16 lines (skeleton with TODO comments)  \n- `useFileSearch.js`: 44 lines (partial implementation with basic search logic)\n- Additional skeleton files: `FileGrid.vue`, `FilePreview.vue`, `FileDetails.vue`, `ViewModeToggle.vue`, `FileTypeFilters.vue` (all basic skeletons)\n- Composables: `useFileViewer.js`, `useFilePreview.js`, `useViewerNavigation.js` (skeleton files)\n- Utils: `fileViewerUtils.js`, `previewGenerators.js` (skeleton files)\n\n**Total Existing**: ~15 skeleton files with approximately 200 lines of placeholder code\n\n### Integration Points\n- Existing upload system uses hash-based file identification\n- Firebase Storage already configured and working\n- Authentication system with team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- Vuetify components and styling system established\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Data Layer Setup (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium  \n**Dependencies**: None  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Based on Firebase documentation and 2024 best practices, optimal Firestore collection patterns recommend using lowerCamelCase field names, avoiding sequential document IDs to prevent hotspots, and implementing subcollections for hierarchical data. For file metadata, the recommendation is to denormalize data for query performance while keeping documents under 1MB. The pattern of using hash-based IDs (already implemented in upload system) aligns with best practices for avoiding monotonically increasing IDs that can cause latency issues.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: All data model changes are additive only. New `tags` field can be removed from existing documents without breaking upload functionality. Firestore security rules can be reverted to previous state if needed.\n\n- [ ] Create Firestore collection structure for file metadata\n- [ ] Implement data migration from existing upload system  \n- [ ] Create Pinia store for organizer state management\n- [ ] Add Firestore security rules for organizer data access\n\n### Step 2: Core Components (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1 (data layer)  \n\n- [ ] Enhance existing `Organizer.vue` view component  \n- [ ] Build `FileList.vue` component for displaying files\n- [ ] Complete implementation of existing `FileListItem.vue` skeleton (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Create `TagInput.vue` component for tag management\n\n### Step 3: Tag Management System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Medium\n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 2  \n**Internet Research Summary**: Vue 3 tag input best practices for 2024 recommend using established UI libraries (PrimeVue, Vuetify, Shadcn/Vue) for production applications. Vuetify's chip component provides built-in accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation. Custom implementations should leverage Composition API with composable patterns for reusability. The recommended pattern includes reactive tag arrays, input validation, and proper event handling for add/remove operations.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Tag functionality can be disabled via feature flag. Firestore writes for tags can be wrapped in try/catch with rollback to previous tag state on failure.\n\n- [ ] Implement tag input interface with add/remove functionality\n- [ ] Create tag display with visual indicators using Vuetify chips\n- [ ] Add tag persistence to Firestore\n- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates for tag changes\n\n### Step 4: Search and Filter (Low Complexity)  \n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low\n**Dependencies**: Step 2, Step 3  \n\n- [ ] Complete existing `FileSearch.vue` skeleton component (currently 16 lines)\n- [ ] Enhance existing `useFileSearch.js` composable (currently 44 lines with basic logic)\n- [ ] Implement real-time filtering logic in store\n- [ ] Add filter state management and persistence\n\n### Step 5: Navigation and Routing (Low Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: Step 2\n\n- [ ] Add \"Organizer\" route to Vue Router configuration\n- [ ] Update navigation sidebar with Organizer link  \n- [ ] Implement route guards for authentication\n- [ ] Add proper page titles and meta information\n\n### Step 6: Integration with Existing System (High Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: High  \n**Dependencies**: Step 1, Step 5  \n**Internet Research Summary**: VueFire (official Vue.js Firebase bindings) provides the recommended 2024 approach for Firebase Storage integration with Vue 3. The `useStorageFile()`, `useStorageFileUrl()`, and `useStorageFileMetadata()` composables offer reactive bindings that automatically sync metadata changes. The pattern involves importing composables from VueFire and using reactive references for file operations, which aligns with our existing Firebase setup.\n\n**Rollback Mechanism**: Integration changes can be isolated behind feature flags. Existing upload functionality remains unchanged. If metadata sync fails, system falls back to upload-only mode. Database queries can be reverted to original upload system patterns.\n\n- [ ] Connect to existing Firebase storage system using VueFire patterns\n- [ ] Leverage existing file upload metadata without breaking current functionality\n- [ ] Ensure team-based data isolation maintains existing security model\n- [ ] Test integration with existing authentication system\n\n### Step 7: Testing and Polish (Medium Complexity)\n**Breaking Risk Level**: Low  \n**Dependencies**: All previous steps  \n\n- [ ] Write unit tests for new components  \n- [ ] Add E2E tests for organizer workflow\n- [ ] Test with large file collections\n- [ ] Performance optimization and loading states\n\n## File Structure\n\n### Files to Enhance (Already Exist as Skeletons)\n```\nsrc/features/organizer/\n├── components/\n│   ├── FileListItem.vue (16 lines → enhance)\n│   ├── FileSearch.vue (16 lines → enhance)  \n│   ├── FileGrid.vue (skeleton → enhance for list view)\n│   └── FileDetails.vue (skeleton → enhance for tag display)\n├── composables/\n│   ├── useFileSearch.js (44 lines → enhance)\n│   └── useFileViewer.js (skeleton → enhance)\n└── views/\n    └── FileViewer.vue (skeleton → repurpose as main Organizer view)\n```\n\n### New Files to Create\n```\nsrc/features/organizer/\n├── components/\n│   └── TagInput.vue (new)\n├── stores/\n│   └── organizer.js (new)\n├── services/\n│   └── organizerService.js (new)\n└── composables/\n    └── useOrganizer.js (new)\n```\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Layout Structure\n- Header with search/filter bar\n- Main content area with file list table\n- Each row shows: filename, file type icon, upload date, tags, actions\n- Tag display as small chips/badges\n- Inline tag editing capability\n\n### Vuetify Components\n- `v-data-table` or `v-list` for file listing\n- `v-chip` for tag display\n- `v-text-field` for search and tag input\n- `v-icon` for file type indicators\n- `v-card` for overall layout container\n\n## Data Flow\n\n1. **File Loading**: Organizer store fetches file metadata from Firestore on mount\n2. **Tag Assignment**: User clicks tag input → opens inline editor → saves to Firestore → updates local state\n3. **Filtering**: User types in search → store computes filtered results → UI updates reactively\n4. **Tag Management**: Add/remove tags → optimistic UI update → Firestore write → error handling\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Store actions and getters\n- Component prop handling and events\n- Tag input validation and formatting\n- Filter logic correctness\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Firestore data operations\n- Authentication integration\n- Route navigation and guards\n- Cross-component data flow\n\n### E2E Tests\n- Complete organizer workflow\n- Tag assignment and search\n- Integration with existing upload system\n- Performance with multiple files\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Initial Implementation\n- Simple approach suitable for moderate file collections (100-1000 files)\n- Client-side filtering for responsive UI\n- Basic loading states during data fetch\n\n### Future Optimization Points\n- Virtual scrolling for large collections (planned for v1.9)\n- Server-side filtering for very large datasets\n- Lazy loading of file metadata\n- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data\n\n## Security Requirements\n\n### Firestore Rules\n```javascript\n// Ensure users can only access their own team's files\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /fileMetadata/{fileId} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth != null \n        && resource.data.teamId == request.auth.uid;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Data Validation\n- Sanitize tag input to prevent XSS\n- Validate file access permissions\n- Ensure team isolation in all operations\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Existing Systems\n- **Upload System**: Leverage existing file metadata and hash-based deduplication\n- **Authentication**: Use existing team-based isolation (teamId === userId for solo users)\n- **Storage**: Connect to existing Firebase Storage for file access\n- **Routing**: Integrate with existing Vue Router and navigation\n\n### Future Versions\n- Tag structure extensible to category-based system (v1.1)\n- Component architecture supports AI integration (v1.3)\n- Data model compatible with confidence scoring (v1.4)\n- UI framework supports virtual folder views (v1.2)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### Functional Requirements\n- [ ] Users can view all uploaded files in organized list\n- [ ] Users can assign text-based tags to any file\n- [ ] Users can search/filter files by tag text\n- [ ] System maintains existing upload functionality\n- [ ] All operations respect team-based data isolation\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- [ ] File list loads within 2 seconds for 100 files\n- [ ] Tag filtering responds within 500ms\n- [ ] Tag assignment saves within 1 second\n- [ ] UI remains responsive during all operations\n\n### User Experience Requirements\n- [ ] Intuitive interface requiring minimal learning\n- [ ] Consistent with existing application design patterns\n- [ ] Clear visual feedback for all user actions\n- [ ] Graceful error handling and recovery\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Technical Risks\n- **Large File Collections**: Start with client-side filtering, monitor performance\n- **Concurrent Tag Updates**: Implement optimistic updates with rollback capability\n- **Firestore Costs**: Monitor query patterns and implement pagination if needed\n\n### User Experience Risks\n- **Feature Discoverability**: Clear navigation and introductory help text\n- **Tag Management Complexity**: Keep v1.0 simple, defer advanced features to later versions\n- **Data Migration**: Ensure existing uploaded files are properly indexed\n\n## Documentation Requirements\n\n### Developer Documentation\n- Component API documentation\n- Store structure and actions\n- Data model and relationships\n- Testing guidelines and examples\n\n### User Documentation\n- Feature introduction and benefits\n- Step-by-step usage guide\n- Tag best practices\n- Integration with existing
