After a user grants a web app access, this API allows them to read or save changes directly to files and folders on the user's device.\n\n## Directory Handles and Folder Structure\n\n### Core Concepts\n\nCore functionality of this API includes reading files, writing or saving files, and access to directory structure. Most of the interaction with files and directories is accomplished through handles. A parent FileSystemHandle class helps define two child classes: FileSystemFileHandle and FileSystemDirectoryHandle, for files and directories respectively.\n\n### FileSystemDirectoryHandle\n\nThe FileSystemDirectoryHandle interface of the File System API provides a handle to a file system directory.(no content)Provides a handle to a file system directory.\n\n### Accessing Directory Structure\n\nYou can first gain access to them by showing the user a file or directory picker using methods such as window.showOpenFilePicker() and window.showDirectoryPicker(). Once these are called, the file picker presents itself and the user selects either a file or directory. Once this happens successfully, a handle is returned.\n\n### Working with Directory Structure\n\nThe API allows you to create and navigate complex folder structures:\n\nYou can operate as usual on the origin private file system once you have access to the root FileSystemDirectoryHandle. const root = await navigator.storage.getDirectory(); // Create a new file handle. const fileHandle = await root.getFileHandle('Untitled.txt', { create: true }); // Create a new directory handle. const dirHandle = await root.getDirectoryHandle('New Folder', { create: true }); // Recursively remove a directory.\n\n### Directory Iteration\n\nFileSystemDirectoryHandle is an asynchronous iterator. As such, you can iterate over it with a for await...of loop and standard methods such as entries(), values(), and keys(). for await (let [name, handle] of directoryHandle) { } for await (let [name, handle] of directoryHandle.entries()) { } for await (let handle of directoryHandle.values()) { } for await (let name of directoryHandle.keys()) { }\n\n### Origin Private File System (OPFS)\n\nThe origin private file system (OPFS) is a storage endpoint provided as part of the File System API, which is private to the origin of the page and not visible to the user like the regular file system. It provides access to a special kind of file that is highly optimized for performance and offers in-place write access to its content.\n\n## Browser Support and Security\n\n### Current Support\nAt the moment, IE and Firefox don't seem to be supporting the File System Access API. However, there exists a ponyfill called browser-fs-access.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nSecurity has been of utmost concern when designing the API, and access to file/directory data is disallowed unless the user specifically permits it (note that this is not the case with the Origin private file system, because it is not visible to the user).(no content)Furthermore similarly to those APIs, all access to files and directories is explicitly gated behind a file or directory picker.\n\nThe File System Access API in 2025 provides robust support for working with directory handles and folder structures in web browsers, offering both user-accessible file system operations and private file system storage for web applications."}]},"uuid":"9c1e1162-aba4-4fd6-81f2-207bc296c02c","timestamp":"2025-08-27T21:03:45.194Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"File System Access API 2025 directory handle folder structure web browser","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_017fmTArRDKDe31HbDQGzT5q","content":[{"title":"File System API - Web APIs | MDN","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API"},{"title":"The File System Access API: simplifying access to local files | Capabilities | Chrome for Developers","url":"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/file-system-access"},{"title":"FileSystemDirectoryHandle - Web APIs | MDN","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemDirectoryHandle"},{"title":"File System Access","url":"https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/"},{"title":"Origin private file system - Web APIs | MDN","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system"},{"title":"File and Directory Entries API - Web APIs | MDN","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API"},{"title":"Introduction to the File and Directory Entries API - Web APIs | MDN","url":"https://devdoc.net/web/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/File_API/File_System_API.html"},{"title":"GitHub - GoogleChromeLabs/browser-fs-access: File System Access API with legacy fallback in the browser","url":"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/browser-fs-access"},{"title":"How to open a directory | Files and directories patterns | web.dev","url":"https://web.dev/patterns/files/open-a-directory"},{"title":"Getting Started With the File System Access API | CSS-Tricks","url":"https://css-tricks.com/getting-started-with-the-file-system-access-api/"}]},"Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the File System Access API in 2025, particularly regarding directory handles and folder structure access in web browsers:\n\n## File System Access API Overview\n\nThe File System Access API enables developers to build powerful web apps that interact with files on the user's local device, such as IDEs, photo and video editors, text editors, and more.
