Rather than traditional folder storage, it uses a tag-based flat storage system with virtual folder presentations optimized for legal document management workflows.\n     6→\n     7→## Core Purpose\n     8→\n     9→**Primary Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.\n    10→\n    11→**Target Use Cases**:\n    12→- Finding bank statements by institution and account details\n    13→- Locating photographs by location and date\n    14→- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)\n    15→- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation\n    16→\n    17→## Architecture Overview\n    18→\n    19→### Storage Strategy\n    20→- **File Storage**: Continues using Storage 1 (existing Firebase Storage)\n    21→- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection for organization metadata\n    22→- **Reference Architecture**: Evidence entries point to files via fileHash\n    23→- **No File Duplication**: Multiple evidence entries can reference same stored file\n    24→- **Processing States**: Evidence tracks document through processing workflow\n    25→\n    26→### Processing Workflow\n    27→1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)\n    28→2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly\n    29→3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review\n    30→4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples\n    31→\n    32→## Tag System Design\n    33→\n    34→### Category Structure\n    35→- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n    36→- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\", \"Contract\")\n    37→- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability\n    38→\n    39→### Tag Management\n    40→- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options\n    41→- **Configurable Mutual Exclusivity**: Categories can be set as mutually exclusive (one tag per document) or allow multiple tags\n    42→  - Examples: Document Type (mutually exclusive), Keywords (multiple allowed)\n    43→  - User configurable per category during creation/editing\n    44→- **Add/Delete Operations**: \n    45→  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents\n    46→  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files\n    47→- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options\n    48→\n    49→### AI Processing Approach\n    50→- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n    51→- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n    52→- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints\n    53→- **Enhanced AI Suggestions**: AI provides up to 3 tag suggestions per category with individual confidence levels\n    54→- **Rich Data Structure**: AI suggestions stored with confidence levels, human overrides, and reviewer attribution\n    55→- **Priority-Based Processing**: All processed documents enter review queue ordered by confidence (lowest first)\n    56→- **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Uses previously reviewed examples to improve accuracy over time\n    57→\n    58→## User Interface Design\n    59→\n    60→### Flat View (Default)\n    61→- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags\n    62→- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping\n    63→- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n    64→\n    65→### Virtual Folder View\n    66→- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n    67→- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n    68→- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n    69→- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n    70→\n    71→### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n    72→- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n    73→- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n    74→- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n    75→\n    76→## Streamlined AI Workflow (Updated August 30, 2025)\n    77→\n    78→### Immediate AI Tag Application\n    79→- **Direct Application**: AI processes documents and applies tags immediately without interrupting user workflow\n    80→- **Visual Distinction**: Clear visual differentiation between AI-applied and human-reviewed tags\n    81→- **Non-Disruptive Experience**: Users receive immediate value while maintaining natural review opportunities\n    82→\n    83→### AI Tag Visual Design System\n    84→- **AI-Applied Tags**: Colored text and border with white background for unreviewed AI suggestions\n    85→- **Human-Reviewed Tags**: White text and border with colored background after human approval\n    86→- **In-Context Review**: Users can review and approve tags naturally within the document interface\n    87→- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual cues indicate tag source and review status\n    88→\n    89→### Enhanced Data Structure\n    90→- **Multi-Suggestion Support**: AI provides multiple tag options per category with individual confidence levels\n    91→- **Confidence Tracking**: Individual confidence levels stored for each suggested tag\n    92→- **Human Override Recording**: Tracks approval decisions and reviewer attribution for audit trails\n    93→- **Status Tracking**: Records tag lifecycle from AI suggestion to human approval\n    94→\n    95→### Learning Approach\n    96→- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n    97→- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future processing\n    98→- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n    99→- **Performance Analytics**: Rich data enables analysis of AI accuracy vs human decisions over time\n   100→\n   101→## BATES Numbering System\n   102→\n   103→### Legal Workflow Integration\n   104→- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n   105→- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n   106→- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n   107→  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n   108→\n   109→### Numbering Rules\n   110→- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n   111→- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n   112→- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n   113→- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n   114→- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n   115→\n   116→### Deduplication Integration\n   117→- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n   118→- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n   119→\n   120→## Integration with Document Processing Workflow\n   121→\n   122→### Evidence Database Role\n   123→- **Central Registry**: All processed documents tracked in Evidence database\n   124→- **Processing Status**: Tracks files through upload → split → merge pipeline\n   125→- **Quality Tracking**: Records hasAllPages and completeness status\n   126→- **Multi-Storage Support**: References files across uploads/split/merged folders\n   127→\n   128→### Version 1.0 Preparation\n   129→- Evidence schema includes processing fields (unused in v1.0)\n   130→- Storage reference structure supports future split/merged folders\n   131→- Processing status defaults to \"uploaded\" for all v1.0 entries\n   132→- Future versions update these fields without schema changes\n   133→\n   134→## Technical Implementation Approach\n   135→\n   136→### AI Integration\n   137→- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n   138→- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n   139→- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n   140→\n   141→### Data Storage\n   142→- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n   143→- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection `/teams/{teamId}/evidence/`\n   144→- **Storage References**: Evidence documents reference files via:\n   145→  - `storageRef.storage`: Which storage folder (uploads/split/merged)\n   146→  - `storageRef.fileHash`: Unique file identifier\n   147→- **Display References**: Evidence points to specific metadata records via:\n   148→  - `displayCopy.metadataHash`: Points to chosen originalMetadata record\n   149→  - `displayCopy.folderPath`: User-chosen folder path from that record\n   150→- **Processing Metadata**: Evidence tracks isProcessed, hasAllPages, processingStage\n   151→- **Tag Storage**: Separated by source (tagsByAI, tagsByHuman arrays)\n   152→- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n   153→\n   154→### Performance Considerations\n   155→- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n   156→- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n   157→- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n   158→\n   159→## User Stories\n   160→\n   161→###

Ideas\\Organizer-Feature-Reference.md","content":"# Organizer Feature Reference Document\n\n## Overview\n\nThe **Organizer** is an AI-powered document discovery and organization system designed to help users find previously uploaded files through intelligent categorization and flexible viewing interfaces. Rather than traditional folder storage, it uses a tag-based flat storage system with virtual folder presentations optimized for legal document management workflows.\n\n## Core Purpose\n\n**Primary Goal**: Enable users to quickly locate previously uploaded documents through intuitive search and categorization methods.\n\n**Target Use Cases**:\n- Finding bank statements by institution and account details\n- Locating photographs by location and date\n- Tracking document relationships (amendments, responses to letters)\n- Organizing documents for legal disclosure and trial preparation\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Storage Strategy\n- **File Storage**: Continues using Storage 1 (existing Firebase Storage)\n- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection for organization metadata\n- **Reference Architecture**: Evidence entries point to files via fileHash\n- **No File Duplication**: Multiple evidence entries can reference same stored file\n- **Processing States**: Evidence tracks document through processing workflow\n\n### Processing Workflow\n1. **Manual Trigger**: Users select folders/batches for AI processing (not automatic)\n2. **AI Categorization**: Gemini multimodal API processes all file types uniformly\n3. **Confidence-Based Routing**: High confidence → auto-categorized, low confidence → human review\n4. **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Medium confidence files use previously categorized documents as examples\n\n## Tag System Design\n\n### Category Structure\n- **Categories**: User-defined groupings (e.g., \"Document Type\", \"Date\", \"Institution\")\n- **Tags**: Mutually exclusive options within each category (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Statement\", \"Contract\")\n- **Color Coding**: Each category assigned distinct colors with gradient/border variations for scalability\n\n### Tag Management\n- **User-Defined Categories**: Users create custom categories with their own tag options\n- **Configurable Mutual Exclusivity**: Categories can be set as mutually exclusive (one tag per document) or allow multiple tags\n  - Examples: Document Type (mutually exclusive), Keywords (multiple allowed)\n  - User configurable per category during creation/editing\n- **Add/Delete Operations**: \n  - Adding tags prompts for reprocessing existing documents\n  - Deleting tags requires reassignment decision for affected files\n- **Merge Capability**: Achieved through delete operations with reprocessing options\n\n### AI Processing Approach\n- **Unified Processing**: All file types processed through Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n- **No File-Type Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n- **No Size Limits**: Large files processed normally; testing will determine practical constraints\n- **Enhanced AI Suggestions**: AI provides up to 3 tag suggestions per category with individual confidence levels\n- **Rich Data Structure**: AI suggestions stored with confidence levels, human overrides, and reviewer attribution\n- **Priority-Based Processing**: All processed documents enter review queue ordered by confidence (lowest first)\n- **Context-Enhanced Processing**: Uses previously reviewed examples to improve accuracy over time\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### Flat View (Default)\n- **File List**: Filename, file extension, document date, all applicable tags\n- **Color-Coded Tags**: Tags colored by category for visual grouping\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Right-click any tag → \"Show in Folders\" creates virtual folder structure\n\n### Virtual Folder View\n- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: User-selected tag categories become folder levels\n- **Filtered Display**: Only relevant tags shown (folder context already established)\n- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs + back buttons for easy hierarchy traversal\n- **Instant Reorganization**: Change folder hierarchy instantly (just re-presenting same tag data)\n\n### File Actions (KISS Principle)\n- **View**: Document viewer with zoom, pagination (PDFs)\n- **Print to PDF**: BATES-stamped output (not raw download)\n- **No Thumbnails**: Keep interface fast and simple for document-focused workflow\n\n## Streamlined AI Workflow (Updated August 30, 2025)\n\n### Immediate AI Tag Application\n- **Direct Application**: AI processes documents and applies tags immediately without interrupting user workflow\n- **Visual Distinction**: Clear visual differentiation between AI-applied and human-reviewed tags\n- **Non-Disruptive Experience**: Users receive immediate value while maintaining natural review opportunities\n\n### AI Tag Visual Design System\n- **AI-Applied Tags**: Colored text and border with white background for unreviewed AI suggestions\n- **Human-Reviewed Tags**: White text and border with colored background after human approval\n- **In-Context Review**: Users can review and approve tags naturally within the document interface\n- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual cues indicate tag source and review status\n\n### Enhanced Data Structure\n- **Multi-Suggestion Support**: AI provides multiple tag options per category with individual confidence levels\n- **Confidence Tracking**: Individual confidence levels stored for each suggested tag\n- **Human Override Recording**: Tracks approval decisions and reviewer attribution for audit trails\n- **Status Tracking**: Records tag lifecycle from AI suggestion to human approval\n\n### Learning Approach\n- **No Model Training**: System doesn't fine-tune or retrain AI models\n- **Context Enhancement**: Uses human-reviewed examples as context for future processing\n- **Human Priority**: Human classifications weighted higher than AI classifications in context examples\n- **Performance Analytics**: Rich data enables analysis of AI accuracy vs human decisions over time\n\n## BATES Numbering System\n\n### Legal Workflow Integration\n- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n\n### Numbering Rules\n- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n\n### Deduplication Integration\n- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n\n## Integration with Document Processing Workflow\n\n### Evidence Database Role\n- **Central Registry**: All processed documents tracked in Evidence database\n- **Processing Status**: Tracks files through upload → split → merge pipeline\n- **Quality Tracking**: Records hasAllPages and completeness status\n- **Multi-Storage Support**: References files across uploads/split/merged folders\n\n### Version 1.0 Preparation\n- Evidence schema includes processing fields (unused in v1.0)\n- Storage reference structure supports future split/merged folders\n- Processing status defaults to \"uploaded\" for all v1.0 entries\n- Future versions update these fields without schema changes\n\n## Technical Implementation Approach\n\n### AI Integration\n- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n\n### Data Storage\n- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n- **Evidence Database**: New Firestore collection `/teams/{teamId}/evidence/`\n- **Storage References**: Evidence documents reference files via:\n  - `storageRef.storage`: Which storage folder (uploads/split/merged)\n  - `storageRef.fileHash`: Unique file identifier\n- **Display References**: Evidence points to specific metadata records via:\n  - `displayCopy.metadataHash`: Points to chosen originalMetadata record\n  - `displayCopy.folderPath`: User-chosen folder path from that record\n- **Processing Metadata**: Evidence tracks isProcessed, hasAllPages, processingStage\n- **Tag Storage**: Separated by source (tagsByAI, tagsByHuman arrays)\n- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n\n## User Stories\n\n### Document Discovery Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to find bank statements by institution and account details**\n- Given I have uploaded hundreds of financial documents\n- When I need to find Royal Bank of Canada statements for account ending in 334\n- Then I can use tags to

add new tag options to existing categories**\n- Given I encounter a new type of document not in my current system\n- When I add a \"Receipt\" tag to my \"Document Type\" category\n- Then the system asks if I want to reprocess existing documents\n- So that previously uploaded receipts can be properly categorized\n\n**As a user, I want to merge duplicate category options**\n- Given I created both \"Invoice\" and \"Bill\" tags but realize they're the same\n- When I delete the \"Bill\" tag and choose to reprocess affected documents\n- Then all documents previously tagged as \"Bill\" are reconsidered for \"Invoice\"\n- So that I can consolidate my categorization scheme without losing data\n\n### AI Processing Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to process documents in batches by category type**\n- Given I have uploaded a folder of mixed financial documents\n- When I select the folder and choose \"Document Type\" processing\n- Then the AI categorizes documents as statements, invoices, receipts, etc.\n- So that I can organize large batches efficiently without manual sorting\n\n**As a user, I want to review uncertain AI classifications**\n- Given the AI is less than 90% confident about some document categorizations\n- When I access the \"Human Review Required\" folder\n- Then I see the top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n- So that I can quickly correct misclassifications and improve system accuracy\n\n**As a user, I want the system to learn from my corrections**\n- Given I have manually classified several uncertain documents\n- When the AI processes similar documents with medium confidence\n- Then it uses my previous classifications as context examples\n- So that the system becomes more accurate for my specific document types\n\n### Interface

browse documents in a familiar folder structure\n\n**As a user, I want to drill down through multiple folder levels**\n- Given I have organized by \"Document Type\" and want to sub-organize by date\n- When I right-click on a \"2023\" tag and select \"Show in Folders\"\n- Then I get a hierarchy like \"Statement > 2023 > March\"\n- So that I can narrow down to very specific document sets\n\n**As a user, I want to instantly reorganize my folder hierarchy**\n- Given I have documents organized by Type > Date\n- When I decide I want them organized by Date > Type instead\n- Then the reorganization happens instantly without processing delays\n- So that I can experiment with different organizational schemes efficiently\n\n### BATES Numbering Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to print documents with BATES stamps for disclosure**\n- Given I need to provide document disclosure for trial\n- When I print any document from the organizer\n- Then it includes a BATES number like \"Roberts-0001\" \n- So that I can track disclosed documents and prevent disclosure confusion\n\n**As a legal professional, I want consistent BATES numbering per matter**\n- Given I'm working on multiple legal matters\n- When I set different prefixes for each case (e.g., \"Smith-\", \"Jones-\")\n- Then each case maintains its own sequential numbering\n- So that documents are properly organized by matter\n\n**As a lawyer, I want permanent BATES number assignment**\n- Given I've printed a document with BATES number \"Roberts-0001\"\n- When I print the same document again later\n- Then it always prints with the same BATES number\n- So that I maintain consistency in legal proceedings\n\n**As a user, I want protection against BATES numbering mistakes**\n- Given I need to restart my BATES numbering due to an error\n- When I create a new prefix for the same matter\n- Then the old prefix is permanently retired and cannot be reused\n- So that there's no confusion about which numbering sequence is current\n\n### Human Review Interface Stories\n\n**As a user, I want simple review options for uncertain documents**\n- Given the AI presents a document with uncertain classification\n- When I see the
