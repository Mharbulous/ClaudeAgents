However, there are some issues when trying to upload files that aren't actually stored locally on the users computer, but are instead stored locally and downloaded on demadn.  This is common for cloud services like One Drive, Dropbox, etc...\\\n\\\nGetting our app to work perfectly with cloud based on demand files is going to take some time and tinkering, and really just is not a priority.  In the short term, we just need to build an MVP, and for that it would suffice if we just had an error message that could pop up and tell users to download files locally.  Explain that the deduplication requires calculating and comparing SHA 256 hash values for files, and that these hash values can only be calculated if the files are stored locally on your computer.   \n\\\nBut how to detect cloud based on demand folder from a web app?  Security generally prohibits that informatoin from being accessed from a web app.\\\n\\\nSo here is the short term solution I have in mind for the MVP.  We already have a folder analzyer that estimates the amount of time required to dedup and queue file uploads, and the formula for calculating these estimates is calibrated based on files stored locally.  Therefore, if the queueing and deduplicating process is taking longer than the estimated time, it is likely because we are trying to calculate hash values for files that are not stored locally.  So all we need for the MVP is the following:\\\n\\\nTo the Upload Queue:  We add a progress bar component to the right of the text \"Upload Queue\".  This component can be a simple progress bar that fills up over time, based on the estimate that we calculated in the File Upload Options modal.  If the estimate was 5 seconds, then our progress bar component should be set to filll up in 5 seconds.  If the estimate was 15 seconds, then set the progress bar component to fill up over 15 seconds.  After the progress bar is full, we should see a full bar containing a message:  \"Time estimate exceeded by __ seconds\".  And when we exceed the estimated time by more than 30%, a modal popup appears, explaining to the user how deduplicating with SHA 256 works, and explaining that if they are trying to upload files that are not actually stored locally, calculating SHA 256 hash values is impossible and the deduplication cannot work.  For web security reasons, browsers do not share information about whether you store your files locally or on the cloud;  but that the slow speed suggests that your files are not stored locally, and if so they should probably cancel this attempted upload, set all folders to \"Always keep on this device\", and try uploading again when all files are stored locally on this device.  Then give the user the option to stop waiting, or wait for another minute.  If the user clicks stop waiting, we should abort the upload queue.  If the user clicks continue, then close the modal menu for another minute, or hide it, and continue processing for another minute.  Repeat as often as the user clicks continue.  Attempted processing should be continuing even while the modal menus is visible.\\\n\\\nPlease create a markdown plan documenting this interim plan for the MVP by saving it in this folder:  docs\\plans\\Bookkeeper\\TODOs"},"uuid":"567d4dcf-acf4-49c7-842f-bc6cfc042e99","timestamp":"2025-08-25T08:59:57.976Z"}
