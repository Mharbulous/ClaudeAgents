Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.\n\n### Directory Structure\n\nFor repeated workflows—debugging loops, log analysis, etc.—store prompt templates in Markdown files within the .claude/commands folder. These become available through the slash commands menu when you type /.\n\n- **Project-specific**: `.claude/commands/` in your project root\n- **Personal**: `~/.claude/commands/` in your home directory\n- Organize commands in subdirectories. The subdirectories are used for organization and appear in the command description, but they do not affect the command name itself.\n\n### Using Arguments\n\nCustom slash commands can include the special keyword $ARGUMENTS to pass parameters from command invocation. You can also use numbered arguments like `$1`, `$2`, `$3` for more specific parameter handling.\n\nExample:\n```markdown\n# fix-github-issue.md\nPlease analyze and fix the GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS.\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Use `gh issue view` to get the issue details\n2. Understand the problem described in the issue\n3. Search the codebase for relevant files\n4. Implement the necessary changes to fix the issue\n```\n\nPutting the above content into .claude/commands/fix-github-issue.md makes it available as the /project:fix-github-issue command in Claude Code. You could then for example use /project:fix-github-issue 1234 to have Claude fix issue #1234.\n\n## Best Practices for 2025\n\n### Context Management\nScope a chat to one project or feature so that all the context stays relevant. The moment you're done with the feature, use the /clear command to clear out the context and start a fresh conversation.(no content)Pro tip: use /clear often. Every time you start something new, clear the chat. You don't need all that history eating your tokens, and you definitely don't need Claude running compaction calls to summarize old conversations.\n\n### Command Organization\nProject-scoped commands: Stored in your repository and shared with your team are preferred for team collaboration, while user-scoped commands work well for personal workflows.\n\n### Advanced Features\n\n**Frontmatter Support**: Command files support frontmatter, useful for specifying metadata about the command, including:\n- `allowed-tools`: Specify which tools the command can use\n- `argument-hint`: Provide hints for command arguments  \n- `description`: Add command descriptions\n- `model`: Specify which model to use\n\n**Pre-execution Commands**: Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the ! prefix. The output is included in the command context.\n\n### Workflow Integration\nClaude Code supports custom hooks, slash commands, and project-specific configuration.

Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.\n\n### Directory Structure\n\nFor repeated workflows—debugging loops, log analysis, etc.—store prompt templates in Markdown files within the .claude/commands folder. These become available through the slash commands menu when you type /.\n\n- **Project-specific**: `.claude/commands/` in your project root\n- **Personal**: `~/.claude/commands/` in your home directory\n- Organize commands in subdirectories. The subdirectories are used for organization and appear in the command description, but they do not affect the command name itself.\n\n### Using Arguments\n\nCustom slash commands can include the special keyword $ARGUMENTS to pass parameters from command invocation. You can also use numbered arguments like `$1`, `$2`, `$3` for more specific parameter handling.\n\nExample:\n```markdown\n# fix-github-issue.md\nPlease analyze and fix the GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS.\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Use `gh issue view` to get the issue details\n2. Understand the problem described in the issue\n3. Search the codebase for relevant files\n4. Implement the necessary changes to fix the issue\n```\n\nPutting the above content into .claude/commands/fix-github-issue.md makes it available as the /project:fix-github-issue command in Claude Code. You could then for example use /project:fix-github-issue 1234 to have Claude fix issue #1234.\n\n## Best Practices for 2025\n\n### Context Management\nScope a chat to one project or feature so that all the context stays relevant. The moment you're done with the feature, use the /clear command to clear out the context and start a fresh conversation.(no content)Pro tip: use /clear often. Every time you start something new, clear the chat. You don't need all that history eating your tokens, and you definitely don't need Claude running compaction calls to summarize old conversations.\n\n### Command Organization\nProject-scoped commands: Stored in your repository and shared with your team are preferred for team collaboration, while user-scoped commands work well for personal workflows.\n\n### Advanced Features\n\n**Frontmatter Support**: Command files support frontmatter, useful for specifying metadata about the command, including:\n- `allowed-tools`: Specify which tools the command can use\n- `argument-hint`: Provide hints for command arguments  \n- `description`: Add command descriptions\n- `model`: Specify which model to use\n\n**Pre-execution Commands**: Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the ! prefix. The output is included in the command context.\n\n### Workflow Integration\nClaude Code supports custom hooks, slash commands, and project-specific configuration. You can combine custom commands with:\n- MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers\n- GitHub integration via `/install-github-app`\n- Automated workflows and CI/CD processes\n\n### Community Resources\nThe Claude Code community has created extensive collections of custom commands, including 119+ custom slash commands, 54 intelligent AI agents, and automated workflows in projects like the Claude Command Suite, providing examples for various development scenarios.\n\nThese best practices emphasize creating reusable, well-organized commands that integrate seamlessly with your development workflow while maintaining clean context management for optimal AI performance."],"durationSeconds":32.808811799999795}}

You just create Markdown files in a special directory structure, and Claude Code automatically recognises them as commands.(no content)Each command is just a Markdown file that contains the instructions I want Claude to execute. The filename (minus the .md extension) becomes the command name. Command files also support interpolation using $ARGUMENTS syntax.

I highly recommend really engaging in building out a robust TDD practice. The robots LOVE TDD. Seriously. They eat it up.(no content)This is a great hack for working with Claude Code. The robot REALLLLLY wants to commit.
