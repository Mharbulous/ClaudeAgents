in context examples\n\n## BATES Numbering System\n\n### Legal Workflow Integration\n- **Print-Only Access**: No raw downloads; only BATES-stamped PDF prints\n- **Disclosure Control**: Prevent confusion about document processing status in legal proceedings\n- **Format Flexibility**: [Optional Letter Prefix]-[Optional Document Number]-[Sequential Number]\n  - Examples: \"Roberts-0001\", \"1.22-0003\", \"Plaintiff-1.22-0003\"\n\n### Numbering Rules\n- **Sequential by Matter**: Each prefix/matter maintains independent sequential numbering\n- **Immutable Assignment**: BATES numbers \"pencilled in\" after processing, \"inked\" after first print\n- **Reprint Consistency**: Same document always prints same BATES number\n- **No Reassignment**: Once printed, BATES number permanently locked\n- **Reset Protection**: New prefix required for numbering resets; old prefixes never reused\n\n### Deduplication Integration\n- **Hash-Based Prevention**: Upload system prevents duplicate file uploads\n- **Near-Duplicate Handling**: Similar but different files each receive unique BATES numbers\n\n## Technical Implementation Approach\n\n### AI Integration\n- **Primary API**: Google Gemini for multimodal document processing\n- **Processing Strategy**: Let Gemini handle file-type optimization internally\n- **Future-Proof Design**: Avoid custom optimization that becomes obsolete as AI improves\n\n### Data Storage\n- **Firebase Integration**: Leverage existing authentication and storage infrastructure\n- **Metadata Storage**: Firestore documents track tags, categories, processing history, BATES assignments\n- **Team Isolation**: All data scoped by team ID (solo users: teamId === userId)\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Background Processing**: AI calls handled asynchronously with progress tracking\n- **Instant UI Updates**: Virtual folder reorganization requires no backend processing\n- **Scalable Visuals**: Gradient colors and borders provide unlimited category combinations\n\n## User Stories\n\n### Document Discovery Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to find bank statements by institution and account details**\n- Given I have uploaded hundreds of financial documents\n- When I need to find Royal Bank of Canada statements for account ending in 334\n- Then I can use tags to filter by \"Institution: RBC\" and \"Account: ...334\"\n- So that I can

encounter a new type of document not in my current system\n- When I add a \"Receipt\" tag to my \"Document Type\" category\n- Then the system asks if I want to reprocess existing documents\n- So that previously uploaded receipts can be properly categorized\n\n**As a user, I want to merge duplicate category options**\n- Given I created both \"Invoice\" and \"Bill\" tags but realize they're the same\n- When I delete the \"Bill\" tag and choose to reprocess affected documents\n- Then all documents previously tagged as \"Bill\" are reconsidered for \"Invoice\"\n- So that I can consolidate my categorization scheme without losing data\n\n### AI Processing Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to process documents in batches by category type**\n- Given I have uploaded a folder of mixed financial documents\n- When I select the folder and choose \"Document Type\" processing\n- Then the AI categorizes documents as statements, invoices, receipts, etc.\n- So that I can organize large batches efficiently without manual sorting\n\n**As a user, I want to review uncertain AI classifications**\n- Given the AI is less than 90% confident about some document categorizations\n- When I access the \"Human Review Required\" folder\n- Then I see the top 3 AI suggestions with confidence percentages\n- So that I can quickly correct misclassifications and improve system accuracy\n\n**As a user, I want the system to learn from my corrections**\n- Given I have manually classified several uncertain documents\n- When the AI processes similar documents with medium confidence\n- Then it uses my previous classifications as context examples\n- So that the system becomes more accurate for my specific document types\n\n### Interface Navigation Stories\n\n**As a user, I want to start with a comprehensive flat view**\n- Given I have many documents with various tags\n- When I first access the organizer\n- Then I see all files with color-coded tags by category\n- So that I can understand my entire document collection at a glance\n\n**As a user, I want to create folder views by clicking on tags**\n- Given I see documents with various \"Document Type\" tags in flat view\n- When I right-click on a \"Statement\" tag and select \"Show in Folders\"\n- Then my view reorganizes into folders by document type\n- So that I can browse documents in a familiar folder structure\n\n**As a user, I want to drill down through multiple folder levels**\n- Given I have organized by \"Document Type\" and want to sub-organize by date\n- When I right-click on a \"2023\" tag and select \"Show in Folders\"\n- Then I get a hierarchy like \"Statement > 2023 > March\"\n- So that I can narrow down to very specific document sets\n\n**As a user, I want to instantly reorganize my folder hierarchy**\n- Given I have documents organized by Type > Date\n- When I decide I want them organized by Date > Type instead\n- Then the reorganization happens instantly without processing delays\n- So that I can experiment with different organizational schemes efficiently\n\n### BATES Numbering Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to print documents with BATES stamps for disclosure**\n- Given I need to provide document disclosure for trial\n- When I print any document from the organizer\n- Then it includes a BATES number like \"Roberts-0001\" \n- So that I can track disclosed documents and prevent disclosure confusion\n\n**As a legal professional, I want consistent BATES numbering per matter**\n- Given I'm working on multiple legal matters\n- When I set different prefixes for each case (e.g., \"Smith-\", \"Jones-\")\n- Then each case maintains its own sequential numbering\n- So that documents are properly organized by matter\n\n**As a lawyer, I want permanent BATES number assignment**\n- Given I've printed a document with BATES number \"Roberts-0001\"\n- When I print the same document again later\n- Then it always prints with the same BATES number\n- So that I maintain consistency in legal proceedings\n\n**As a user, I want protection against BATES numbering mistakes**\n- Given I need to restart my BATES numbering due to an error\n- When I create a new prefix for the same matter\n- Then the old prefix is permanently retired and cannot be reused\n- So that there's no confusion about which numbering sequence is current\n\n### Human Review Interface Stories\n\n**As a user, I want simple review options for uncertain documents**\n- Given the AI presents a document with uncertain classification\n- When I see the 3 AI suggestions plus \"Other\" and \"Create New Category\" buttons\n- Then I can quickly select the correct option or create a new one\n- So that document review is fast and doesn't interrupt my workflow\n\n**As a user, I want to create new categories during review**\n- Given I encounter a document type not in my current system\n- When I click \"Create New Category\" during human review\n- Then the system asks if I want to reprocess other documents for this new category\n- So that I can expand my taxonomy as I discover new document types\n\n### Legal Workflow Stories\n\n**As a lawyer, I want to prevent raw document downloads**\n- Given clients or opposing parties might create confusion with untracked copies\n- When I access any document in the organizer\n- Then I can only print BATES-stamped versions, not download raw files\n- So that all document copies in circulation are properly tracked and identified\n\n**As a legal professional, I want to track document processing history**\n- Given I need to verify whether documents have been properly processed\n- When I review any document's metadata\n- Then I can see whether it was classified by AI or human review\n- So that I can ensure quality control in my document management process\n\n## User Experience Flow\n\n### Initial Setup\n1.
