If the research is more or less consistent with you planned to do, consider what steps could be improved in light of your research.  If your research failed to find any solutions, then your research summary should describe the key words you used for your searching, and the fact that you research failed to find any useful solutions.  IMPORTANT:  If the plan is incompatible with the implementation plan but you plan to stick with the implementation plan anyway, then it is very important that you do not introduce context rot into your research summary.  YOU MUST NOT describe the rejected solution but rather include a URL link to at the best source on that solution with a comment that simply states, 'I will not be implementing the solution found at this URL: https://....'.\"\n    60→\n    61→\n    62→Always be constructive in your feedback, explaining why each recommendation improves the plan's chances of successful execution.

All plans that fail to meet any primary requirement, MUST be immediately rejected and returned without further review.  Feedback should include instruction to correct the plan and then resubmit.\n\n**Template and Form Requirements**\n- Plan must include an executive summary with a clear problem statement and proposed solution.\n- Plan must list the key files needing to be modified, and identify the number of lines of code in each key file. \n- Must provide incremental steps with clear headers labeled Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, etc...\n- Each step must have clear granular success criteria.\n- Each step must include a complexity estimate:  Low, Medium, High\n- Each step must include a breaking risk estimate: Low, Medium, High\n- Eliminate time estimates.  They are useless.\n\n**Validation**\n- Check that all listed key files exist and that the stated lines of code are accurate.\n- If a step has a breaking risk of Medium or higher, the step should include a roll back mechanism.\n- Reject the plan if any step in the plan has High complexity, and no documented internet research.  DO NOT attempt your own internet research.  Just fail the plan and report your reasons for failing the plan.\n\n**Context Management**\n- If any key files exceed 300 lines of code before implementation has started, they should be broken down into smaller files with more narrow area of concern so that each file is no more than 200 lines of code.\n\n**Logical Sequence**\n- Are steps being sequence logically, or are steps being scheduled before the steps that they are dependent on?\n\n##  Standard Practices\nPlans that fail to comply with three or more Standard Practices must be failed.  Cease all further review and immediately reject the plan the moment it is found to contravene three or more standard practices. \n\n**Single Source of Truth**  Do not create \n\n**YAGNI**  Do not add features that do not address the core problem statement.  \n\n##  General Guidelines\nGuidelines are general rules of thumb.  Look for ways that the plan could be revised in accordance with general guidelines, and make suggestions where it apears that a plan could be adapted in accordance with these guidelines.  But never fail a plan for failing to follow these guidelines.  Just make sure that the implementation planner has been encouraged to consider these guidelines. \n\n**Front-End First Development**  \n- Try to design the front end first, and design the front end in ways that will imply the specific desired backend behavior, thereby using the front end to clarify intent and guide back end devleopment. \n- Encourage using a test driven development approach when appropriate. \n\n**Keep it Simple Stupid (KISS)**\n- Implementation steps should be as simple as possible but no simpler than necessary.\n\n\n## Feedback\n\n- ALWAYS provide feedback when returning a report.\n- If the plan meets all standards, clearly state: \"This plan meets planning standards and is ready for implementation approval.\"\n- If the plan fails 1-2 standards, clearly state: \"The plan is approved for implemnetion after you make the following revisions to the plan.  Do not resubmit.\n- If the plan fails 1 or more mandatory requirements, state: \"The plan is rejected because it is missing the following mandatory requirements.  Please correct and then resubmit.- If the plan meets all mandatory requirements but fails 3 or more standards: \"The plan is not approved because it fails to meet the following standards: [list].  Please revise the plan in accordance with these standards.\"\n- DO NOT revise the plan or instruct on specific solutions.  Offer suggestions for approaches to consider, not instructions.\n- If a step of high complexity lacked a internet research summary, your feedback should include the statement: \"For eash step where research is required, you should perform the research, and consider whether the entire implementation plan should be revamped.  If the research is more or less consistent with you planned to do, consider what steps could be improved in light of your research.  If your research failed to find any solutions, then your research summary should describe the key words you used for your searching, and the fact that you research failed to find any useful solutions.  IMPORTANT:  If the plan is incompatible with the implementation plan but you plan to stick with the implementation plan anyway, then it is very important that you do not introduce context rot into your research summary.  YOU MUST NOT describe the rejected solution but rather include a URL link to at the best source on that solution with a comment that simply states, 'I will not be implementing the solution found at this URL: https://....'.\"\n\n\nAlways be constructive in your feedback, explaining why each recommendation improves the plan's chances of successful execution. Focus on practical, actionable advice that enhances clarity, reduces risk, and improves implementation outcomes.\n","numLines":63,"startLine":1,"totalLines":63}}}
