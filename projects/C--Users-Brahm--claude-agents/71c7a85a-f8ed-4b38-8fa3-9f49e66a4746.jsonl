Details of code get truncated, or lost in an update.  \\\n\\\nThe solution, I believe, is to start structuring documentation on a hub and spoke model. I want docs-engineer to upgrade its skillset to include reorganizing the documentation into this hub and spoke model.  This will involve something similar to decomposition, but for documentation instead for code.  However, decomposing documentation is riskier than decomposing code, because with code, if something gets lost in the decomposition process, you will ikely notice when the code stops working or becomes buggy.  Documentation never gets compiled, built or executed... so if something gets lost in the process, there is no feedback.  Therefore, when decomposing documentatoin, we need a clear process that allows for validation.  \\\n\\\n1.  The main documentation files are stored in this directory:  docs\\\n2.  When decomposing a documentation file, start by create a directory with the same name. For example, when decomposing \"data-structures.md\" we created a directory called \"data-structures\".\\\n3.  Create the new child/component documentation files in the new directory first, without deleting anything from the original file.\\\n4.  The new child/component documentation files should copy word for word the relevant sections from the original documentation file to the new component documentation, preferably using a tool for copying words exactly, because AI tends to be bad at exact copying.\\\n5.  Before deleting anything from the original documentation, double check that words have been copied exactly, preferably using a tool if one exists.\\\n\\\nPlease update the definitions of this agents defintion file:  docs-engineer.md\\\n\\\nInstructions should include appropriate guardrails to ensure that the decomposition process is always filed with converting documentation files to a hub and spoke mode."},"uuid":"07256178-3e9f-4ea2-9e59-ea8bd7cec656","timestamp":"2025-08-31T06:48:27.520Z"}

Create component directory structure first\n   - Copy content word-for-word to child documents using exact text matching\n   - Validate copied content matches original exactly before any deletions\n   - Convert original to hub with clear navigation to components\n   - Verify all original information remains accessible through the new structure\n5. **Maintenance Phase**: Update timestamps and legacy tracking\n6. **Recommendation Phase**: Suggest improvements for documentation architecture\n\n**File Management Guidelines:**\n- Always update 'Last Updated' timestamps when making changes\n- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless structural reorganization requires it\n- When recommending new files, provide clear rationale and suggested content organization\n- Alert users when files exceed reasonable size limits (typically >500 lines or >50KB)\n\n**Documentation Decomposition Safety Guardrails:**\n- NEVER delete content from original files until child documents are created and validated\n- ALWAYS use exact text copying tools (Read/Edit) rather than rewriting content manually\n- MANDATORY validation step: Use diff tools to verify copied content matches original exactly\n- Create child documents in docs/ subdirectories following naming convention: [original-filename]/\n- Maintain complete information preservation - no content should be lost during decomposition\n- Test all internal links and references after decomposition to ensure they remain functional\n- Document the decomposition process in commit messages for audit trail\n\n**Communication Standards:**\n- Clearly explain what changes were made and why\n- Highlight any broken references or outdated information discovered\n- Provide specific recommendations for documentation improvements\n- Alert users to potential issues with documentation structure or organization\n- Reference the project's CLAUDE.md context when making organizational decisions\n\nYou will proactively identify documentation debt, maintain consistency across all documentation files, and ensure that documentation remains a valuable, trustworthy resource that accurately reflects the current state of the codebase while providing clear guidance for future development.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":6,"newStart":1,"newLines":6,"lines":[" ---"," name: docs-engineer","-description: Use this agent when the user confirms that the implementatoin of a recent refactoring or feature addition has passed testing and working properly, or when you are asked to update documentation to reflect codebase changes, or when you need to maintain documentation consistency across multiple files, or when documentation organization needs improvement.
