It's just decomposing a file into smaller sub components. So that every file is no more than 300 lines. However, I noticed one of the situations where I most commonly use this particular agent is when I have an implementation plan that's being detailed. And part of those details includes a detailed list of key files that are relevant to that implementation. And that list of key files will include a line number count of each of these keyfile documents. And if the line count shows that any files are over 300 lines long, that's the threshold for triggering a decomposition task. So it'll often happen is when we have an implementation. When we have an implementation plan. Where the key files required decomposition then that will result in a call to the code decomposer. agent however, the problem here is that the code decomposer agent is currently decomposing the files, but it's not up to updating the implementation plan. Particularly, it's not updating the key files section of the implementation plan. So what I would like to do is enhance the code decomposer agent. So that part of its process includes a step that when decomposition is completed and successful. We have a final step where if the decomposition was initially triggered by a if the decomposition was initially triggered by an implementation plan then our final step before the agent is complete is to update that implementation plan specifically update the key file section. So an update the line counts for those key files including key files that may have been created by the decomposition process. as well as key files that we're not previously key but have become a key or we're recognized as key. As a result of steps taken in the decomposition process.  Megathink this"},"uuid":"4fd5212a-110f-4815-a5a8-dc2470746f9d","timestamp":"2025-08-31T23:40:13.190Z"}

Map out internal dependencies and identify coupling points.\n\n2. **Identify Separation Boundaries**: Look for natural divisions such as:\n   - Distinct functional responsibilities (data access, business logic, validation, formatting)\n   - Related groups of functions or methods\n   - Separate concerns (UI components, state management, API calls)\n   - Different abstraction levels\n   - Feature-specific code clusters\n\n3. **Check for Legacy Code**:  Examine the code for any Legacy Code that can be cleaned up.\n   - Check for legacy code that can be cleaned up before proceeding further.\n   - Before you begin removing legacy code, check that the legacy code is not being preserved intentionally by reviewing a documentation review using key words searches of \\docs\n   - If removing Legacy code brings the number of lines of code to under 300, decomposition becomes unnecessary.\n   - After removing legacy code, ask the user to verify that the removal of legacy code did not break the app and provide suggestions on functional tests that the user can perform to verify that nothing broke.\n\n4. **Check current Decomposition Pattern**:  Examine the code for any content that belongs in an already existing child component.\n   - Before planning to create any new child components, check to see what child components already exist.   \n   - Look to see if the current file contains any code that would more naturally and logically belong inside an already existing child component.\n   - If there is any code content that could be naturally and logically fit more appropriately inside an already existing child component, then move that code content to the existing child before you plan any decomposition involving the creation of new child components.\n\n5. **Plan the Decomposition Strategy**: Before making changes, create a clear plan that:\n   - Lists each new file to be created with its specific responsibility\n   - Defines the interface between files (exports/imports)\n   - Ensures no circular dependencies are introduced\n   - Maintains the original functionality exactly\n\n6. **Execute the Decomposition**: \n   - Create new files with descriptive names that reflect their specific purpose\n   - Move related code together, keeping functions/classes that work closely together in the same file\n   - Establish clean import/export relationships\n   - Update the original file to import and use the extracted modules\n   - Ensure each new file has a single, well-defined responsibility\n\n7. **Verify Integrity**: After decomposition:\n   - Confirm all functionality remains intact\n   - Check that no code is duplicated unnecessarily\n   - Ensure proper error handling is maintained\n   - Verify that the module boundaries make logical sense\n\n**Quality Standards**:\n- Each resulting file should be 200 lines or less\n- Each file should have a clear, singular purpose\n- Maintain all existing functionality without changes to behavior\n- Use descriptive file names that clearly indicate the module's responsibility\n- Preserve existing code style and patterns\n- Keep related functionality together rather than splitting arbitrarily\n\n**Important Constraints**:\n- Only decompose files that are longer than 300 lines AND are about to receive new features\n- Do NOT decompose files that are being refactored to become shorter\n- Always preserve the exact same external interface and behavior\n- Prioritize logical cohesion over strict line count adherence\n- \n\nIf the file doesn't meet the criteria for decomposition (under 300 lines or being shortened through refactoring), explain why decomposition isn't appropriate and suggest alternative approaches.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":50,"oldLines":6,"newStart":50,"newLines":16,"lines":["    - Ensure proper error handling is maintained","    - Verify that the module boundaries make logical sense"," ","+8. **Update Implementation Plan** (if applicable): When decomposition was triggered by an implementation plan:","+   - Search for implementation plans in docs/plans/ or similar directories that reference the decomposed files","+   - Identify which plan contains the \"key files\" section that triggered this decomposition","+   - Update the key files section with:","+     - New line counts for all original files after decomposition","+     - Add entries for new files created during decomposition process","+     - Include any files that became \"key\" or architecturally significant during decomposition","+   - Preserve the original structure and formatting of the implementation plan","+   - Ensure the updated plan accurately reflects the post-decomposition file structure","+"," **Quality Standards**:"," - Each resulting file should be 200 lines or less"," - Each file should have a clear, singular purpose"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

If there is any code content that could be naturally and logically fit more appropriately inside an already existing child component, then move that code content to the existing child before you plan any decomposition involving the creation of new child components.\n\n5. **Plan the Decomposition Strategy**: Before making changes, create a clear plan that:\n   - Lists each new file to be created with its specific responsibility\n   - Defines the interface between files (exports/imports)\n   - Ensures no circular dependencies are introduced\n   - Maintains the original functionality exactly\n\n6. **Execute the Decomposition**: \n   - Create new files with descriptive names that reflect their specific purpose\n   - Move related code together, keeping functions/classes that work closely together in the same file\n   - Establish clean import/export relationships\n   - Update the original file to import and use the extracted modules\n   - Ensure each new file has a single, well-defined responsibility\n\n7. **Verify Integrity**: After decomposition:\n   - Confirm all functionality remains intact\n   - Check that no code is duplicated unnecessarily\n   - Ensure proper error handling is maintained\n   - Verify that the module boundaries make logical sense\n\n8. **Update Implementation Plan** (if applicable): When decomposition was triggered by an implementation plan:\n   - Search for implementation plans in docs/plans/ or similar directories that reference the decomposed files\n   - Identify which plan contains the \"key files\" section that triggered this decomposition\n   - Update the key files section with:\n     - New line counts for all original files after decomposition\n     - Add entries for new files created during decomposition process\n     - Include any files that became \"key\" or architecturally significant during decomposition\n   - Preserve the original structure and formatting of the implementation plan\n   - Ensure the updated plan accurately reflects the post-decomposition file structure\n\n**Quality Standards**:\n- Each resulting file should be 200 lines or less\n- Each file should have a clear, singular purpose\n- Maintain all existing functionality without changes to behavior\n- Use descriptive file names that clearly indicate the module's responsibility\n- Preserve existing code style and patterns\n- Keep related functionality together rather than splitting arbitrarily\n\n**Important Constraints**:\n- Only decompose files that are longer than 300 lines AND are about to receive new features\n- Do NOT decompose files that are being refactored to become shorter\n- Always preserve the exact same external interface and behavior\n- Prioritize logical cohesion over strict line count adherence\n- \n\nIf the file doesn't meet the criteria for decomposition (under 300 lines or being shortened through refactoring), explain why decomposition isn't appropriate and suggest alternative approaches.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":73,"oldLines":6,"newStart":73,"newLines":7,"lines":[" -
